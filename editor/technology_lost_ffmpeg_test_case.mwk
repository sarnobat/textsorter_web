==== Creating and cloning a new repo ====

 # it is good practice to use a bare repo on the server
 git init --bare

works on linux
 git clone ssh://sarnobat@netgear.rohidekar.com:2222/home/sarnobat/Desktop/oracle.git

works on windows (does it?)
 git clone ssh://sarnobat@netgear.rohidekar.com:2222/sarnobat.git

first git push will have a problem, so do this:

 git push origin master

The more pieces of your program are stateless (i.e. use static methods), the more ways there are to put pieces together without having anything break.

==  ==
data is how software breathes (as humans breathe oxygen)

good visualizations are those that aid cognition (and thus memorability) of data

=== code writing ===
test functionality, not methods
==  ==

=== git linux ===


 cd /home/sarnobat/Desktop/
 mkdir git-repo
 git init
 # git protocol is on 9418
 # you get ocnnection refused if you forget to start the daemon

 # Start the server
 nohup git daemon --export-all --base-path=/home/sarnobat/Desktop/

 # Clone to client (you get connection refused if the daemon isn't running)
 git clone "ssh://netgear.rohidekar.com:2222/sarnobat.git"
 git clone "ssh://sarnobat@netgear.rohidekar.com:2222/sarnobat.git"

=== git windows setup ===

1. Install msysgit

2. Set up user
git\etc\git-config

 [user]
     name = Your Name
     email = email@example.com

3. in regular cmd.exe
 # base path should be one level about your repo
 git daemon --export-all --base-path=E:/

You can then do 
 git clone "git://foo/my-repo"
Using with http is harder. You can't do it with instaweb
=== gitweb ===

 sudo port install lighttpd
 git instaweb
 touch .git/git-daemon-export-ok

===== Basic conversion (lossy) =====
 ffmpeg -i Animals.webm Animals2.mp4

===== Lossless conversion =====
 ffmpeg -i Animals.webm -sameq Animals2.mp4

 When converting video files, you can use the '-sameq' option which 
 uses the same quality factor in the encoder as in the decoder.  
 It allows almost lossless encoding.

==== indexing all nodes so rest can fetch all ====

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16442425/neo4j-auto-indexing-issues/17204874#17204874

I also had this issue with version 1.7-SNAPSHOT.

It seems there are 2 properties, one being a duplicate of the other:

node_autoindexing_enabled=true # Commented out in neo4j.properties - but has no effect
node_auto_indexing=true        # Not in the file at all, but when added did index new nodes
node_keys_indexable=name,_id
It seems the 2nd one enables indexing but the 1st one does not. Hopefully if this is a bug it will get addressed (or has been addressed since the version I downloaded).

Unchecked exceptions are those that extend RuntimeException class. Compiler will never force you to catch such exception or force you to declare it in the method using throws keyword. All other exception types (that do not extend RuntimeException) are checked and therefore must be declared to be thrown and/or catched.

=== Code writing ===

In an object dependency graph, If you see a class "skipping" the indirection, see if you can remove the skip

In an object dependency graph, if you see a class used by multiple parents, move it to a "common" subpackage

A Manager class does the creation, printing and modifying of an object
== Technology ==

=== Design patterns ===

Is there such a thing as a manager design pattern?

Sounds like you're after the mediator pattern - which can be thought of as a 'manager' of the objects that it deals with.

Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather thaninheritance. Some describe how a group of peer objects cooperate toperform a task that no single object can carry out by itself. Animportant issue here is how peer objects know about each other. Peerscould maintain explicit references to each other, but that wouldincrease their coupling. In the extreme, every object would knowabout every other. The Mediator (305) pattern avoidsthis by introducing a mediator object between peers. The mediatorprovides the indirection needed for loose coupling.

The mediator serves as an intermediary that keeps objects in the groupfrom referring to each other explicitly. The objects only know themediator, thereby reducing the number of interconnections.

Mediator (305) is similar to Facade in that it abstracts functionality of existing 
classes. However, Mediator's purpose is to abstract arbitrary communication 
between colleague objects, often centralizing functionality that doesn't belong 
in any one of them.

=== Guiceberry ===
JUnit and most other test frameworks are well-designed to handle simple tests -- those that exercise one or a small number of classes in isolation, and don't need setup of complex external dependencies. But once you need to write fully automated tests that depend on starting servers, setting up databases, and the like, these frameworks do very little to help you.  You're left to build your own framework -- usually in the form of layers upon layers of base classes for test cases to extend.

2 letter linux commands

	ls /bin/?? /usr/bin/?? /sbin/?? /usr/sbin/??

And looked them all up.

From /bin we get:

	cp - copy files and directories
	dd - convert and copy a file
	df - report file system disk space usage
	ex - start vim in ex mode
	ln - make links between files
	ls - list directory contents
	mv - move (rename) files
	ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.
	rm - remove files or directories
	sh - Bourne shell (linked to Bash for me)
	su - run a shell with substitute user and group IDs
	vi - I made this a link to vim

From /usr/bin we get:

	ab - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool
	ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
	as - the portable GNU assembler.
	cc - link to gcc on my box
	du - estimate file space usage
	ex - start vim in ex mode
	gs - Ghostscript (PostScript and PDF language interpreter and pre- viewer)
	id - print user identity
	ld - The GNU linker
	lp - print files
	m4 - macro processor
	nl - number lines of files
	nm - list symbols from object files
	od - dump files in octal and other formats
	pr - convert text files for printing
	rb - receive with Ymodem
	rx - receive with XModem
	rz - receive with ZModem
	sb - send with YModem
	sg - execute command as different group ID (an alias for newgrp)
	sm - Jabber IM session manager
	sx - send with XModem
	sz - send with ZModem
	tr - translate or delete characters
	ul - do underlining
	wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

From /sbin we get:

	ip - show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels
	iw - show / manipulate wireless devices and their configuration
	tc - show / manipulate traffic control settings

From /usr/sbin we get:

	ss - Show sockets

So now you know.
	sg was a cool discovery for me.

	Also don't forget the one character commands...
	[ - test - check file types and compare values
	w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
	X - X Windows

The shell is a hierarchy traversal language. FUSE file systems are so powerful because you can browse any hierarchy. The more FUSE file systems you can implement for abstract concepts, the greater your productivity.

=== perl ===
stands for Practical Extraction/Report Language

 -p   causes perl to assume the following loop around  your
          script,  which  makes  it iterate over filename argu-
          ments somewhat like sed:

               while (<>) {
                    ...       # your script goes here
               } continue {
                    print;

          suppress  printing use the -n switch.  A -p overrides
          a -n switch.


       -e commandline
            may be used to enter one line of script.  Multiple -e
            commands may  be  given  to  build  up  a  multi-line
            script.   If  -e  is  given, perl will not look for a
            script filename in the argument list.

          the 24 hour clock, values must be between 0 and 23 (0 is midnight)
 dom	This is the Day of Month, that you want the command run on, e.g. to
 	 run a command on the 19th of each month, the dom would be 19.
 month	This is the month a specified command will run on, it may be specified
 	 numerically (0-12), or as the name of the month (e.g. May)
 dow	This is the Day of Week that you want a command to be run on, it can
 	 also be numeric (0-7) or as the name of the day (e.g. sun).
 user	This is the user who runs the command.
 cmd	This is the command that you want run. This field may contain 
 	 multiple words or spaces.

 If you don't wish to specify a value for a field, just place a * in the 
 field.

 e.g.
 01 * * * * root echo "This command is run at one min past every hour"
 17 8 * * * root echo "This command is run daily at 8:17 am"
 17 20 * * * root echo "This command is run daily at 8:17 pm"
 00 4 * * 0 root echo "This command is run at 4 am every Sunday"
 * 4 * * Sun root echo "So is this"
 42 4 1 * * root echo "This command is run 4:42 am every 1st of the month"
 01 * 19 07 * root echo "This command is run hourly on the 19th of July"

 perl -M"Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular 'to_singular'" -e 'print(to_singular("tags"))'
 perl -MMIME::Base64 -e 'print encode_base64("string")' 



the "-p" switch. Specifying "-p" to a Perl program causes it to assume the following loop around your program:

 while (<>) {
    # your program goes here
 } continue {
    print or die "-p failed: $!\n";
 }

$_ is an implicit local variable which holds the result of the last function/builtin called.

=== Hadoop concepts (just to job memory) ===
coins
combiner is handled by framework. You only need to identify the key
streaming - command line
script can be shipped to each machine as part of task submission
ssh + xargs = poor man's hadoop
Input - e.g. 1-1000
Splits of the input - e.g. 1-50, 51-100, 101-150
Records of a split - e.g. 1, 2, 3 ... 50
WordCount outputs text files, which are great for human readers, but what if you want to read the output from one Map-Reduce job as the input for a second Map-Reduce job? Use SequenceFileInputFormat and SequenceFileOutputFormat to write and read key-value pairs without worrying about serialization. 

=== Map Reduce foolproof explanations ===

a) (library one was good)

b) a huge collection of coins
Divide the coins into a few unsorted batches
map phase: ask 1 friend (server) to determine the value of each coin
put the coin into his coin sorter (but it's dumb - you have to tell it what the value is)
shuffle phase: the coin sorter will accumulate all coins into a barrel for that particular coin
hand the stacks of each coin value to the master
reduce: The master discards all copper coins, and saves the silver ones in separate collections.
By the end of the reduce phase, the master will have a subtotal of quarters, of nickels, and of dimes

=== Remapping keys in Linux ===
Start terminal window and run xev. Now it's active and what's for you pressing a key. Then press a key, it's behaviour you want to change. i.e. PgUp.

xev will output some information on the pressed key. Important is the third line. it should look similar like this

state 0x10, keycode 110 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,
in this example Prior is the name of the behaviour the key is assigned to at the moment, the number keycode is the internal id to recognize the key. Now do this with another key i.e. PgDown give this output

state 0x10, keycode 115 (keysym 0xff56, Next), same_screen YES,
again here what's interesting for us is keycode 115 and Next - the name of the behaviour.

now when you want to swap this both keys use xmodmap.

 xmodmap -e "keycode 110 = Next"
changes the key with keycode 110 on your keyboard to the action Next. It's pretty simple.
http://askubuntu.com/questions/24916/how-do-i-remap-certain-keys

Modern systems don't generally use xmodmap to configure the keyboard, though. setxkbmap is the modern way to do it; and that does reset bindings when run. So you may be able to use setxkbmap -layout us

==== Textmate commands ====
This isn't ideal, but it's the only thing that works in all cases

===== Headingize existing line (e.g. Sridhar - heading 2) =====
* type: command
* command: perl -pe 's{^(.*)$}{== $1 ==}g'
* input: selected text or line
* output: replace selected text

===== Insert heading (e.g. Sridhar - heading 2 - Business) =====
* command:
* echo "== Business =="
* input: selected text or line
* output: insert as text

<!--
	=== insert heading (works - except when current line is blank you get too many blank lines. A trim command would fix this) ===
	echo "== Productivity ==
	$TM_CURRENT_LINE"

	==== make current line a heading (works) ====
	Input: selected text or line
	output: replace selected text
	perl -pe 's{^(.*)$}{== $1 ==}g'


	==== Textmate snippet - DOESN'T WORK (doesn't erase existing line) ====
	(yes, textmate snippets can be unix commands. But don't make a 'command'. Make a 'snippet')
	`echo $TM_CURRENT_LINE | perl -pe 's{^(.*)$}{=== $1 ===}g'`

	==== insert heading (works EXCEPT you can't have a blank line) ====
	Input: selected text or line
	output: replace selected text

Operating systems are difficult to debug with traditional
cyclic debugging. They are non-deterministic; they run
for long periods of time; they interact directly with hard-
ware devices; and their state is easily perturbed by the act
of debugging.

Under Unix based operating systems non interactive server applications are called daemons and are controlled by the operating system with a set of specified signals. Under Windows such programs are called services and are controlled by appropriate calls to specific functions defined in the application binary,

Files with the extension msf are not message (mail) files at all. They are message summary files, indexes for lack of a better term. If you are accessing an IMAP server the messages remain on the email server, not on the local computer, so there is no mbox file. There will still be an msf file so that Thunderbird an keep track of various status values relating to the messages on the server.

 Put the CD in the drive. Go to System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager. Click Settings -> Repositories and check that the CD is in the list (or add it if it's not). Click OK to close the Repositories dialog and click the Update button on the main interface. If you do not have internet, synapic may complain that it could not get to a bunch of repositories. Don't worry about that.

 Then, hit Ctrl + F, enter "tcsh" and Search. A new list of packages comes up. Right-click on tcsh, select "Mark for installation", click teh dialog away and hit the "Apply" button on the main screen. Synaptic will install tcsh for you and report any problems.

 It you cannot install tcsh this way, try the csh package.
