Indians began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living the UK even in the earlier years. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. Later arrivals opened corner shops or ran post offices. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

According to the 2010 United States Census,[15] the Asian Indian population in the United States grew from almost 1,678,765 in 2000 (0.6% of U.S. population) to 2,843,391 in 2010 (0.9% of U.S. population), a growth rate of 69.37%, one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, although it is still one of the smallest communities in the US, not even completely one percent.[16][17][18][19]

The first major wave of migration, albeit forced, was the mass importation of slaves, predominantly from Africa, in the time period between America's founding and the early 19 century. Slave importation was banned in 1808, ostensibly ending this mass migration. African migrants' early and tragically immoral introduction to the United States has plagued Americaâ€™s conscience arguably more than any other historical event. Their presence resulted in seminal legislation and legal decisions, most notably in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, all of which have helped define American identity.

In the US so much new product is produced (e.g. for TV) that old product doesn't get rebroadcast. It's easier to find reruns in the UK or India of American TV shows like Simpsons, Friends and Wrestling than it is in the US itself.

apache web server on Windows to serve Atletico Html folder
add support to hoist for local html files (or better yet to online photo sorter), where clicking on one allows you to read the page locally (not over a webserver) - but I haven't thought about how you would transfer images, js, css etc.

Why is bollywood so western obsessed ? There is absolutely nothing indian about this dance or video except the song. Where are the indian clothes? Indian steps? And its not just this song, most of the videos these days are the same. Is it "cool" to act/dress like a westerner in India? ???

Narration: "On the other hand, some patients do not have problems remembering the past..." (end of sentence, then some video that depicts such patients having problems with the future without the narration saying so directly)

Foreshadowing or guessing ahead is a literary device by which an author hints what is to come.[1] It is used to avoid disappointment
