in a good economy, smaller companies like Dabs can function. But once it goes through a bad economy it will get sold off to a bigger company like BT shop

2016-10-02 - Exactly 50 years after the first Calderon match, Atletico faced the same opposition at the Mestalla. Griezmann would have his penalty saved a minute before half time. Atletico would get the opening goal, but Gabi would also have his penalty kick saved by the heroic Diego Alves. Gameiro confirmed the points with the last kick of the game after Valencia threatened to equalize several times. Barcelona and Real Madrid's failure to get maximum points on the same match day meant Atletico Madrid leapfrogged their city neighbors into 1st place on goal difference.

2016-09-28 Bayern home. Just like last season's semi final, Atletico won 1-0. Also just like last season's final, Carrasco scored but Griezmann hit the bar from the spot. It was also the first time Bayern had failed to score in a competitive match since their last trip to the Calderon 5 months earlier.

For many women, it's hard to get a well developed set of glutes. A lot of women are actually afraid of working that area because they don't want to make it bigger than it already is. (This is kinda like men who don't want to work their abs because they believe that it'll give them a bigger belly.)

Indians began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living the UK even in the earlier years. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. Later arrivals opened corner shops or ran post offices. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

20th century

Although post-war immigration was continuous, several distinct phases can be identified:
* workers were recruited to fulfill the labour shortage that resulted from World War II. These included Anglo-Indians who were recruited to work on the railways as they had done in India.
* Workers mainly from the Punjab and Gujarat regions arrived from India in the late 1950s and 1960s. Many worked in the foundries of the English Midlands. Large numbers of Gujaratis worked in the textile manufacturing sector in the northwest industrial towns of Blackburn, Dewsbury, Bolton, Lancaster, Manchester and Preston. Sikhs coming to London either migrated to the East to set up businesses where the wholesale, retail and manufacturing elements of the textile industry were located. Many Sikhs also moved to West London and took up employment at Heathrow airport and the associated industries and in the plants and factories of major brands such as Nestle around it.
* During the same time, medical staff from India were recruited for the newly formed National Health Service. These people were targeted as the British had established medical schools in the Indian subcontinent which conformed to the British standards of medical training.
* During the 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of East African Indians, predominantly Gujaratis but also sizeable numbers of Punjabis who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. Many of these people had been store-keepers and wholesale retailers in Africa and opened shops when they arrived in the UK.

In the nine-year period between 2001 and 2010, the number of Indian-born people in the UK has increased in size by 43% from 467,634 to around 669,000 (an increase of over 200,000).[12]
