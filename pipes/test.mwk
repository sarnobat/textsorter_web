2016-10-02 - Exactly 50 years after the first Calderon match, Atletico faced the same opposition at the Mestalla. Griezmann would have his penalty saved a minute before half time. Atletico would get the opening goal, but Gabi would also have his penalty kick saved by the heroic Diego Alves. Gameiro confirmed the points with the last kick of the game after Valencia threatened to equalize several times. Barcelona and Real Madrid's failure to get maximum points on the same match day meant Atletico Madrid leapfrogged their city neighbors into 1st place on goal difference.
===  ===
2016-09-28 Bayern home. Just like last season's semi final, Atletico won 1-0. Also just like last season's final, Carrasco scored but Griezmann hit the bar from the spot. It was also the first time Bayern had failed to score in a competitive match since their last trip to the Calderon 5 months earlier.

For many women, it's hard to get a well developed set of glutes. A lot of women are actually afraid of working that area because they don't want to make it bigger than it already is. (This is kinda like men who don't want to work their abs because they believe that it'll give them a bigger belly.)

Every human being is born with inferiority feelings inherited by human nature from birth. We all start life with some feelings of inferiority. 

But in some individuals, Many years of feeling inferior may manifest into Inferiority Complex.

The inferiority feeling is only normal when people face extreme life situations. However, in the case of individuals suffering from the inferiority complex, this feeling manifests itself continuously and constantly along one's life.

Thus, Inferiority Complex makes an individual emotionally and mentally unstable, limiting him or her to live life to the fullest.

Since inferiority complex makes one lose confidence in oneself the individual suffers from low self esteem.

Administrators often prefer to keep related sets of files in different locations or media, as it is easier to maintain those files separately. Users, on the other hand, prefer to see all files in one location for convenience.
===  ===

For ease of management, it can be useful to keep related but different sets of files in separate locations. Users, however, often prefer to see these related files together. In this situation, unioning allows administrators to keep such files separate physically, but to merge them logically into a single view. A collection of merged directories is called a union, and each physical directory is called a branch.

=== How to avoid space after a contex special character tag? ===

I want to put an image in my document that has an underscore in the URL:

http://localhost/Photos/IMG_046.jpg

I need to escape the underscore using `\underscore` but without a space after it, it won't recognize the tag name:

    {\externalfigure[http://localhost/Photos/IMG\underscore046.jpg][vhs]}{}

If I put a space, the URL will be incorrect:

    {\externalfigure[http://localhost/Photos/IMG\underscore 046.jpg][vhs]}{}

(i.e. it will resolve to: "http://localhost/Photos/IMG 046.jpg" )

What is the right way to delineate the tag but not end up with an unwanted space?

2016-09-18 Gameiro opened his account for Atletico with a picturesque curling strike, adding to his compatriot Griezmann's goal minutes earlier. The game wasn't even 5 minutes old at that point.

2015-08-16 This was scheduled to be the last season at the Calderon but due to issues with the planned use of the Manzanares site, the move was postponed 12 months.

=== How Humor Heals ===
Laughter stimulates the body's natural painkillers and 'feel good' enhancers, known as endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. When Norman Cousins was diagnosed with the debilitating illness ankylospondylitis, the doctors told him they could no longer help him and that he would live in excruciating pain before he died. Cousins checked into a hotel room and hired every funny movie he could find: the Marx Brothers, Airplane and The Three Stooges, etc. He watched and re-watched them over and over, laughing as hard and loud as he could. After six months of this self-inflicted laughter therapy, the doctors were amazed to find that his illness had been completely cured - the disease was gone! This amazing outcome led to the publishing of Cousins' book, Anatomy of an Illness, and the start of massive research into the function of endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals released from the brain when you laugh. They have a similar chemical composition to morphine and heroin and have a tranquillising effect on the body, while building the immune system. This explains why happy people rarely get sick and miserable but complaining people often seem to be ill.

I am certainly not jealous of you except for some practical aspects (you are good with tools, you worked towards getting your place in a place that you could engage in the things you care about etc -- and you helped me get basic cable in my place!). 
I am a bit more dangerous in that I have a level of superficial charm that can occasionally impress girls (like that blonde girl, who BTW looked a lot like Phoebe from Friends) -- but in my experience leads to nothing long term :P 
I am proud of my skills, ashamed of my weaknesses, and overall deeply insecure that my overall set of skills/temperament/acts are often maladapted to this world. And you (like the blonde girl who blocked me) are one of the few people I confess this to. And I bet you won't block me for "manipulating" you (granted, my interaction with you ain't quite the same, with the girl I also had a romantic interest, whereas with you...hehe not at all) :)

Yeah. I was going to say I am guilty of manipulating people for sympathy myself. Here is a text I just found, sent to a girl I met a few months ago: "I find it hard to behave like an attractive man should: confident and strong. It is natural to me to be vulnerable and talk about my weaknesses, but I suspect I overdo it. These are issues that can be tricky to emotional men like me. Don't get me wrong, women have it worse in lots of ways -- but (and this is a pet peeve of mine) a sad woman often gets sympathy a lot more easily than a guy does."

Sexual touch are all the sexually exciting forms of touch that prepare a woman for intercourse, including:
* Touching her inner thighs
* Placing your hand on her butt
* Rubbing her breasts and genitals
* Kissing her neck or other parts of her body besides the mouth
* Biting or nibbling on any part of her

Modern social media makes it so easy for everyone to share their opinion that a secondary side effect is that opinions rarely matter anymore. Lots of causes get started but lose steam quickly.
Political transitions that once took a generation to happen, no longer happen because people don't have the energy to attach to a different cause every month, no matter how worthy.
I am not entirely convinced of the above myself, but is legitimate food for thought. I was going to post this with restrictive privacy settings, but this post is probably so boring that it is unlikely to get attention. Which is possibly true of most Facebook posts unless one has put in the effort to make the post popular (being popular oneself, or using marketing techniques).
Garnering attention on Facebook posts seems to me to take efforts broadly similar to the efforts of politicians. Facebook may give the illusion that it is easy to get traction with a post, but in practice it isn't.
I am making this public despite how boring it is. The unfortunate thing is, I am sure I am not the only one who stops posting because my posts get no attention. I didn't get married or have a kid.
I am coming to the late conclusion that Facebook is not a platform for the disenfranchised to express their opinion.

What is making love?

It's what a woman does when a guy is fucking her.

===  ===
Bras also cause self-consciousness in preteens and young adults. Preteen girls who develop faster than their peers often wear bras that are too small in order to diminish the noticeability of their developing breasts.  Doing this at an early age can cause shame about her body well into adulthood.

Because a woman's breasts are her feelings and emotions made visible. A young girl's breasts are beautiful in the sense she is like an emotionally unopened bud that has a lot to give.

where is the head? That’s right, laying on the chest, on the breasts. Soothing. comforting, transmitting love. It is intangible, but no less real. This is how ... transmit the nurturing, loving energy ... This is how women transmit loving energy to their lovers as well, through their breasts. (By the way, this is how a man gives loving energy too, but his breasts are flat, so he transmits to his lover a sense of sturdy stability, of reliability and strength, as opposed to the woman's nurturing ).

Hormones of pleasure inundate his body in sheer ecstacy, feeling deep peace and pleasure in his own body and profound connection to their woman. At the same time, since breasts are connected to the womb, a woman is inundated with pleasure hormones as well and orgasmic sensations. This is the power of the breast. 

The breasts are her source of her feminine essence and must be lovingly activated to allow the love and energy to overflow naturally. The more a woman can be totally present in the feelings and sensations of her breasts, the more she will know her exquisite softness, femininity and power.

This also allows her to really know herself as love and to overflow with universal love to all around her. As a man, I just find my lover in her feminine to be so beautiful, soft, exquisite and desirable. This allows my masculine to be effortlessly activated and the resulting polarity leads to amazing, profound and exquisite sex.

Anshu initial encounter

unfortunately I never had time to write this immediately afterwards. It's now April 17th 2016 but before I meet her again I want to recapture whatever remaining memory I have of our first meetings.

I was sitting in a Cafe Coffee Day outside the mall waiting, trying to look as smart as I could. I only succeeded to some extent - I'd broken my hair straightener and simple combing doesn't work well on my hair.

I don't vividly remember what she looked like, but of course she looked classy in whatever "rug" top she was wearing. I don't think I was nervous. I'm only nervous when there is something to lose but at that point my attachment to her hadn't had time to fully develop (I think we'd been chatting for about 3 months but just once a week and not about very intimate things).

I think she reached out to shake my hand. I'd always been reactive to handshakes with women after my mom told me you don't touch ladies in India. I don't remember what I felt when seeing her in person looks wise. I think she was about what I had expected from the photos, maybe slightly better. But in any case I had tried not to get my hopes up because it was still quiet early in our interaction.

We ended up going to the other Cafe Coffee Day and all I remember is me being a bit insistent on something - probably finding the quietest possible table to talk. At first I didn't notice the noise but the longer the meeting went on the more I began to notice. Probably it didn't help that she had a very quiet voice.

I ended up apologetically showing one of my dance videos that she said she was eager to see. But I could sense it wasn't that interesting. I'd shown her Summer Funk 2010, something I'd blacklisted after the events of less than a year later. I think I had wanted her to see me with the microphone (which didn't seem to impress her).

The one thing I'd noticed both in person and in text chats was how much she used the word "unto" which I found curious and slightly amusing. I remember she smelt like chocolate - which was nice but made me feel a bit awkward because I didn't want to imagine eating her!

Also I noticed her teeth were a bit crooked when she opened her mouth to talk. That's not a criticism - they're either same or better than my crooked teeth (I regret not getting braces when I was younger). And they were neither white nor yellow - almost a grey color (maybe again that was because of the poor lighting). I don't remember at all what we talked about!

And of course the most fun part that I like to write. What I thought of her physically. There was both good and bad in what I had the opportunity to observe. She was wearing a very loose top like I said earlier, and I had a glorious view of her breasts. My goodness they were big. I've not been someone who requires big breasts on my girl, so they exceeded my expectations. I couldn't tell if it was the result of shapewear or whether that really was her structure. But since it was still early in our interaction I didn't indulge in erotic fantasizing. Even now I haven't quite gotten the exposure from her that I need to fantasize more. But hopefully the time will come for that soon.

The bad news was that I couldn't get a good view of her butt.  I was never behind her at any point in the meeting. I was in front of the whole time. The closest I attempted was when we got up and were leaving Cafe Coffee Day when I was standing beside her. I did my best to see her from behind but didn't get a good view, only a glance. Read on and I'll explain what happened in the subsequent encounter in this regard.

Complexion wise she was indeed fair. But not that sunkist yellowish tone that some Indian girls blatantly, albeit genuinely, advertise and that Indian grooms' families seek (at the expense of other physical characteristics like build in many cases). It was more of a pale brown.

As we were departing I was trying to make a note of how to describe her to my mom looks wise. I ended up saying she looks a bit like Sayan Das' mom (though Sayan's mom was very attractive at the expense of education so I wasn't holding Anshu to that standard).

I was looking for clues of whether she was interested in me or not and the only possible clue I could find was whether she looked at me after parting ways and getting in an auto. She didn't look at me after waving from the other side of the road.

==== Meeting 2 ====
The main thing I remember is how annoying those flies were in the other Cafe Coffee Day and the music, and the temperature. But I was glad to meet her sister and Arav. My mom really seemed to like her sister and Arav. I was surprised actually.

And my mom said just before they walked into CCD something showing approval of her looks (I had tempered her expectations): "Yep, she's good looking." What was funny was I didn't even notice she'd arrived by the time my mom had seen her and made her judgment.

==== Meeting 3 ====
I felt a bit guilty that I was almost intruding on Priya's home by telling Anshu I want to meet at one of our homes, but I'm glad we did. It was really nice to see her sister's family (and I liked the pasta she made). My favourite part was Rishika. As we know, little girls melt my heart and she was no exception. Very well behaved too. I was talking to her more than Anshu and mom told me later that I was not looking at Anshu implying it was wrong. But I'd met Anshu twice at that point and we didn't have much more to talk. She continued to be quiet like an obedient younger family member. She was a little bit more humble, nervous almost I sensed. But she looked nice in her salwar. I don't remember the color but she looked nice.

[11:52 PM, 8/20/2016] Sridhar Sarnobat: Though if you turn around and look, or tilt your head or close your eyes maybe that will be enjoyable enough

[11:53 PM, 8/20/2016] Sridhar Sarnobat: When guys treat girls as "objects', it's not  understood that guys consider them very fun, lovable objects ❤
[11:53 PM, 8/20/2016] Sridhar Sarnobat: that they want to explore the texture of in the ways I described above⁠⁠⁠⁠

I just want to pick that girl up and rub my cheek against hers, then tickle her a little, then squeeze her a little, then put her down and run around with her

<!-- the kind of thing Madhu might write -->
With the innocence of a baby and the kindness of a gentleman, Sridhar is a rare breed. He's the son every mother dreams of. Not to mention, he's incredibly smart. You'll learn a lot from him. But he's so sensitive. Don't hurt him, he's really delicate.

<!-- the kind of thing Ketki might write -->
A really fun guy to be friends with. You'll have lots of laughs with him.

<!-- Teju -->
Sridhar's a good guy and has a big heart. Don't lose him as a friend, you'll regret it.

<!-- Anuraddha aunty, Meghana -->
A good influence and role model. I hope my children grow up to be like him.

<!-- Dr Asku -->
A real gentleman and handsome. Very few guys are like him.

<!-- Daxaji, Latta aunty -->

Sridhar's so kind-hearted, he'll go to the end of the earth if you need him. And he's got a great sense of humor. You are really lucky to have him as your friend!!!

Many tasks can be kept active for ages as you revisit them to improve and polish your work, looking for the perfect way to finish a report or complete a user interface. If you’re having this problem, it’s time to try a technique from agile software development: timeboxing.

Timeboxing recognizes that the scarce resource in life is often time. In the context of a software project, this means dealing with a fixed delivery date. Instead of trying to build a product with every possible wishlist feature, no matter how long it takes, a development team using timeboxing commits to building the best possible product by a particular fixed date. It’s a different way of tackling the trade-off between time and quality. Agile teams will timebox every interim release: the software ships every Friday, for example, with whatever features can be finished in that week.

causing you to neglect other important tasks.

At the start of the task, pick an appropriate amount of time to spend, based on your past experience and your own knowledge of your skills and work habits.

The goal is to use your time wisely, by actually finishing tasks to an appropriate quality bar and then moving on to the next thing, rather than picking at them and polishing.

The key to successful timeboxing is to think of tasks, not as amorphous blobs, but as chunks of work that have particular durations attached to them. If you’ve been struggling with an out-of-control task list, try timeboxing your biggest, nastiest tasks (or break them up into subtasks and timebox those) and see if this way of working helps you out.

Automobiles may not offer the same compatibility as an alluring female, but studies from the Stanford School of Business suggest that when a man is denied an object of affection, not only will he want it more, he will like it less once he has it. Researchers are not exactly sure why this happens. During a breakup, a man will have the advantage of gaining a woman’s interest again once she realizes she can no longer have him. Unfortunately, if he gets back into the relationship, due to the rules of the game, he will likely be thrown back to the curb once she realizes she was right the first time. In other words, the more difficult a man is to get, the higher your expectations and the more likely you are to be disappointed. The lesson is, don’t fall for your own game. - See more at: http://www.austinwomanmagazine.com/articles/the-allure-of-being-elusive#sthash.0K6McRV7.dpuf

Boys want to impress girls, girls want to look good in front of boys

===  ===

For young women today, how- ever, the demonstration of their sexuality, via everything from clothing, to music, to explicit forms of overt sexual behavior, is portrayed as something that increases their social power.

For some girls, the desire to wear a bra is especially fervent, even if only for decora- tive purposes. Many proudly put on a training bra or a starter bra while their breasts are still undeveloped. Coupled with this is a yearning to “fit in” with friends who are older or have ampler breasts.Having finally traversed the threshold into long-awaited wom- anhood, they are elated to be thought of as “grown up.” New bras are admired with excitement, wonder, and awe. However, the new wearer of these badges of femininity is soon faced with an array of expectations, including insistence that she keep up to date with popular styles and color trends and that she conform to fashion’s dictation of an ide- alized, average size.

Some girls dislike and avoid wearing a bra. Girls may bind their breasts in an attempt to hide their development. For many, puberty’s breast buds and the impending bra repre- sent a disheartening situation that signals the end of childlike freedoms, including going topless or engaging in active events. Some girls who behave in a manner that is usually considered boyish frequently dread the development of their breasts and the wearing of a bra, often interpreting the experience as the beginning of their being forced into typically feminine social roles and behaviors.

For some, the bra is embarrassing. Mothers and other caregivers are frequently blamed for coercing the young girl into wearing a bra when she doesn’t want to, and bra-buying day can be a traumatic ordeal. Disliking or loathing the bra, some girls try to disguise it behind dark-colored shirts or sweaters. Other girls are proud of their new bras but may still be embarrassed.

Whether or not a girl reveals her new bra to others is a matter of individual preference. Some creatively announce the exciting news to the world that they have officially come of age. Secretly hoping to be noticed, they may pop questions here and there to solicit attention such as, “Is my bra showing?”  Others are not so anxious for attention. Often family or friends draw public attention to a girl’s new bra when she does not want them to. In addition to being humiliating and cruel, teasing of this kind can be disenchanting for girls who might otherwise be excited about their new bra experiences. A girl is often acutely sensitive to what boys and men might think of or comment about her bra. Many are mortified when bra straps are pulled and then snapped back against the skin with a noticeable slapping sound.

Although girls’ breasts evolve into many shapes and sizes, the fashion industry gener- ally focuses on averages and mass production to maximize profits. Bras used to be sewn at home, where they could be adjusted to individual body types. However, in recent decades, bras are almost exclusively created in assembly-line factories according to standardized designs and sizes, which are then purchased in stores. When idealized averages do not fit a girl’s unique breasts, instead of seeing the sizing scheme as the problem, she often self- consciously blames herself, thinking something is wrong with her body.

Girls continue to grapple with sizing issues today. Those with small or large breasts often exert great efforts to find correctly sized bras. Small-breasted girls frequently envy peers who develop faster or more fully or who have more average-sized busts. Some try to make their breasts appear rounded by stuffing material into the cups of larger-sized bras.

Some have suggested that when a bra is used to mold a girl’s breasts into an idealized shape and position that the fashion world promotes, the breasts symbolically change into sexual objects with erotic appeal. Whether or not a girl is aware of these implications, as she puts on the bra, she enters a world of adult behaviors and expectations, thus unwit- tingly marking her body.

Whereas boys tend get tattoos on their arms and shoulders, girls often choose to tattoo their lower back, hips, upper back, ankle, or other areas where the tattoo can be concealed. The derogatory term “tramp stamp” refers to the lower back tattoos popular among young women and reveals lingering stigmas associated with tattooed females. In general, girls tend to choose small tattoos of established images of femininity, such as floral designs, butterflies, ladybugs, and cartoons such as Hello Kitty or Betty Boop.

<!-- 70 Don't worry about unity from piece to piece - what unifies all of your work is the fact that you made it -->

71 If you love different things, you just keep spending time with them. "Let them talk to each other. Something will begin to happen."

72 It's so important to have a hobby. A hobby is something creative that's just for you. You don't try to make money or get famous off it, you just do it because it makes you happy. A hobby is something that gives but doesn't take...No pressure, no plans. It's regenerative.

72 Don't throw any of yourself away. Don't worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. Don't worry about unity - what unifies your work is the fact that you made it. One day you'll look back and it will all make sense.

74 Do good work and share it with people

129 Keep a logbook

129 Just as you need a chart of future events, you also need a chart of past events. A logbook isn't necesasrily a diary or a journal, it's just a little book in which you list the things you do every day. What project you worked on, where you want tto lunch, what movie you saw. It's much eaier than keeping a detailed diary, and you'll be amazed at how helpful having a daily record like this can be especially over several years. The small details will help you remember the big details.

Reading to gain knowledge about how the world works and how humans work is of great value. Knowing how a light switch works and how we make decisions (both good and bad) are worthy things. More than that, though, reading helps you to think, to solve problems, and to understand reality. Read and think about what you read. Find reading material that you like and that will move your mind forward. 

Reading builds your vocabulary and hence your thinking ability because you can think in more refined and complex terms. It also helps improve your writing ability as you grow familar with how sentences, paragraphs, and essays are put together.

In the Indian context,men and women want both success and love.
Women have always valued relationships more than men.They want to be loved,wooed,courted and proposed to.Sure,they are ambitious too like men and are go-getters and achievers.But with age,career takes a backseat for women as they get busy in bringing up kids.Ambition thins out and job becomes a mere duty,a source of livelihood.It no longer defines them as children become their lifelong project.Priorities see a shift with age,esp for women.
For men,success not only gives them security along with a strong sense of self,but also defines a metric on which men are usually judged.Men need to be primary providers.It is not that they do not desire love,but it does not really define them like career does.They have to be successful.A good income is considered a prerequisite to be taken as responsible enough by prospective in-laws for marriage.Men have their ego and self-esteem attached to their professional success.
In my own country I see young guys pursuing engineering without questioning the logic behind it.All they care about is the salary they'll get once a company recruits them and the high social status.
As an aside,I wonder how mind-numbing engineering really is.

=== framework vs library ===
When writing code:

eventually you discover sections of code that you're repeating in your program, so you refactor those into Functions/Methods.
eventually, after having written a few programs, you find yourself copying functions you already made into new programs. To save yourself time you bundle those functions into Libraries.
eventually you find yourself creating the same kind of user interfaces every time you make use of certain libraries. So you refactor your work and create a Toolkit that allows you to create your UIs more easily from generic method calls.
eventually, you've written so many apps that use the same toolkits and libraries that you create a Framework that has a generic version of this boilerplate code already provided so all you need to do is design the look of the UI and handle the events that result from user interaction.

all your classes should fall into a clearly delineated hierarchy.
===  ===
the biggest selling point of OOP is that it can manage complexity via encapsulation, specifically by hiding the state of objects, and exposing their behaviour solely via the interface provided by their methods.
However one does need to know about the state of the program to reason about its execution, but the state is:

Hidden, so one cannot rely on the interface alone, but instead has to inspect the implementation .
Split across multiple objects, so one has to take into account all the objects that are interacting with each other at any given time.
Of course this can be managed for small projects, but it’s an approach that scales poorly: when there are thousand of objects involved, most of which were written and engineered by other people, reasoning about the code is a nightmare.


predicting the program’s behaviour becomes infeasible, leading to:

More bugs, as one doesn’t know what the code is doing, is harder to ensure it’s doing it correctly.
Very (I mean very) difficult debugging, as the execution depends on the state, which could have been changed by any of the methods of any of the objects involved.

Perfectionism is not uncommon in people with aspergers syndrome.

Cross-cultural research has shown gender differences on the domains and facets of the Big Five personality traits. For example, women consistently report higher Neuroticism, Agreeableness, warmth (an extraversion facet) and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness (a facet of extraversion) and openness to ideas as assessed by the NEO-PI-R.[67]

Various studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen,[93] show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis[94] showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.

While most women preferred the middle range -- a combination of both feminine and masculine features -- subjects who were in their most fertile hormonal cycles preferred the more masculine image.

==== impressionable ====
"We found that the slideshow caused women to become more attracted to the men who were being smiled at by other women," said Jones. This shows that people are using the attitudes of others to shape their own judgement about the attractiveness of some people.

In other words, a woman may not be sure how attractive a face is. But if other women show that they're attracted they dismiss their doubt. This may explain the "groupie" and the "cult of personality" phenomenon and why so many ugly men learn to play the guitar.

==== struggle ====

When women are assessing a man's face for a marriage partner they usually react to a man with a wide smile, small eyes, a big nose and a large jaw. This is thought to indicate a strong testosterone level, a potentially good provider and protector for family life.

Studies show that younger women rely more on the physical attractiveness of a man than do older women. The latter incorporate such things as wealth, stability, power and faithfulness in their definition of attractive. This demonstrates wisdom since the most recent studies prove that less attractive men are more faithful and loving than handsome men.

Ashley Montagu said that the following neotenous traits are in women when compared to men: more delicate skeleton, smoother ligament attachments, smaller mastoid processes, reduced brow ridges, more forward tilt of the head, narrower joints, less hairy, retention of fetal body hair, smaller body size, more backward tilt of pelvis, greater longevity, lower basal metabolism, faster heartbeat, greater extension of development periods, higher pitched voice and larger tear ducts.[5]


Because men generally exhibit uniform preference for neotenous women's faces, Elia (2013) questioned if women's varying preferences for neotenous men's faces could "help determine" the range of facial neoteny in humans.[53]

eliminate the time dimension

===  ===

It's a simple thing, and here it might seem more verbose, but as you build code into compositional expressions, you can connect parts together without so many explicit, intermediate "state containers" -- instead you're handing-off results to the next step: dataflow.

===  ===
An overwhelming portion (more than 80% on mature codebases) of software engineering time is spent on software “maintenance” instead of new invention,

Code maintenance, as usually practiced, is dull and lacks creativity. It’s also usually a career tarpit, because new invention is generally superior (from a developer’s perspective) in terms of visibility, education and advancement. 

Maintenance is extremely important work; it’s the upkeep of one of a software company’s most important assets. 

Methods become longer, dependencies are added, junk parameters are added to existing functions, and the architectural intentions behind the original system are buried under thousands of hacks.

if the launch’s success came at the expense of enormous “technical debt” (the interest on which is usurious) then a maintenance time-bomb has been built.
===  ===

 only ever writing to new spaces

=== Bureaucracy in programming ===
On structure, it’s critical that a company of any size separate the “software engineer” job description (which currently entails creative, new invention as well as maintenance) into two separate job descriptions. One (I’ll call it the “software architect” track) exists for the creative engineers who tend to fail at maintenance efforts because of their inability to tolerate ugliness. The other (I’ll call it the “maintenance engineer” track) exists for the “Sherlock Holmes” sort who enjoy deciphering ineptly- or even hostilely-written code. Since qualified maintenance engineers are uncommon, and since most developers find that work undesirable, maintenance engineers should be paid highly. I would argue that a 30% premium is not unreasonable. Moreover, they must be given social status and clout, since their job is to be pains in the asses of developers who are potentially more senior than they are. If maintenance projects are structured and allocated in this way, it’s very unlikely that they will dominate engineering time as they do now.

As a fellow dancer myself you guys have to realize that for us its a career or in otherwords a job and dancing with other guys is just part of it....when ur doing a dance with another guy its just a job its just a dance even though we portray emotion through the dance it doesnt mean anything to either the guy or girl dancer....so as far as all the comments saying that u couldnt believe travis would let her do that needs to calm down. ..its just a dance and its supposed to be expressive and its a story and they wouldnt be doing their jobs right if they didnt give one hundred percent ﻿

=== Felix tribute ===
2015-04-19
(Nicknames: felee, boy, shimby umma, swamy, thimma, dingo, tigey)

Felix carried himself like royalty in more ways than one. Not only did he believe in luxury (sitting in an armchair when mom and dad collected him from his previous owners in Pontypridd on October 6th 1996) but he was chubby, self-satisfied and got people to do what he wanted just by his look.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IpggfXV0VVw/RnF4U6V7HqI/AAAAAAAAARo/Sb8Tl2_FsWU/s640-Ic42/P8090588.JPG

At his happiest, his eyes were half closed, perched on a double bed or sofa with his arms folded. Or sleeping heavily snoring <!-- which rivaled mom's -->, sometimes upside down with his mouth half open showing his teeth.

http://netgear.rohidekar.com:4451/cmsfs/static2//e/Sridhar%20UK/Photos/Cats/Felix%203.JPG

He was born with good looks, most notably his high cheekbones. He looked like he was smiling even when he was neutral.

There was nothing he enjoyed more than lazing in bright sunlight. Though, curiously, when there was only one spot of sunshine he would place his face in it while the rest of his body had to settle for the shade.

There's a saying, "Home is where the cat is." A non-pet owner probably doesn't understand what this means. But in a family that kept changing (children growing and changing in behavior, moving to other cities or countries for school and college, parents losing hair or being diagnosed with health complications, moving homes or retiring), he was the one constant. Whenever I would return home from boarding school for vacations, I couldn't predict how one person would behave to me, whether all 4 of them would be living there, or whether they were all still healthy. But one thing I would always shout as soon as I opened the door was "Felix!". 

The final time I shouted this was December 2013. Unfortunately, this time when I went into the den I had heard about under the kitchen table which was his hospice, all I saw was plastic boxes on new black floor tiles. Then mom confirmed that Felix had died (some seven months earlier). I was not told because of the effect it would have on me. Cutting a long story short, that was the right thing to do. I was lucky not to see him in his ill state and I do not wish to remember him that way. I always think of him as a fluffy, cuddly teddy bear of a cat that one just looked for an excuse to pick up and squeeze. <!-- which dad would do excessively and painfully, too ashamed to display love to him directly. -->

You would think that when I was 6000 miles from home I wouldn't get to feel his presence regularly. But he was so adept at understanding people that he would find a way. Whenever I called mom 8 hours ahead of me, he would sit on her chest so near the phone speaker that I could hear his purring from California and I could immediately recall the image of his face with those half closed eyes and whiskers curving downwards at the end of a long day (of doing very little except spend visiting every room in the house).

He always enjoyed a good brush. He would show it by galloping after me any time I waved my hand across the carpet. After reaching me, he would collapse and roll (sometimes on my feet), tilt his head back and lift his paw. And after the long grooming session was terminated he would turn his head and stare at you like you had betrayed him and should have felt ashamed.

http://netgear.rohidekar.com:4451/cmsfs/static2//e/Sridhar%20UK/Photos/Cats/Felix%20being%20brushed.JPG

He knew how to accept royal treatment gracefully yet shamelessly. That was an art that no one else in the family had mastered. Accepting favours always drew an insecurity out of us, especially me and my mother because we believed so much in being independent to the point we did not want to exist in anyone else's lives. Felix had no trouble accepting attention or luxury.

He was a real people-person. He would follow anyone into the garden, even dad when he would jog around the perimeter. He would interject himself in the middle of Priya's social gatherings at home. We don't think it is coincidence that he was always trying to impress girls (of the human species, that is). Of course, they were all too willing to pamper him. 

Felix never met a box he didn't like. Big, small, cardboard, plastic, white, brown, he'd try them all. Among the funnier containers he'd pass time in were Priya's toy pram, dad's office chair packaging and the christmas card box (in which only his 2 front feet fit). 

http://netgear.rohidekar.com:4451/cmsfs/static2//e/Sridhar%20UK/Photos/Cats/originals/03-04/P8110607.JPG

As with many cats, he would object to humans using the computer and would make us reevaluate our priorities by standing on the keyboard or in my lap; if I wasn't in the green computer chair he would claim it (even if it was just when I'd gone to the bathroom for 5 minutes). 

http://netgear.rohidekar.com:4451/cmsfs/static2//e/Sridhar%20UK/Photos/Cats/Felix%20in%20computer%20chair.JPG

His blindness in the final months of his life wasn't enough to stop him finding the Sky technician's van, as if taking a caravan holiday. And when clean laundry passed by, you could see his nostrils dilate in an apparently sensual experience. If it had slipped your mind that he liked clean laundry then you would be reminded within minutes when you'd find him sleeping comfortably in the middle of it.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pvN-SP9bb9Y/S9PlP02urCI/AAAAAAAACbQ/oolndE42zTo/s912-Ic42/008_33.jpg

Dogs who get fed by humans are said to believe that those humans are god. When cats get fed by humans, the cat supposedly believes that he himself is god. As far as our family is concerned, Felix is a god. He occupies a prominent position in the worship area in our dining room in a photo, and of course in our hearts.

=== Ginger (written by dad 2012-04-18) ===

Regret to inform you our second cat Ginger died last week.  Throught he gave us company pleasure and loyalty. He  insisted to be treated as one of the family members and whenever guests came he will sit next to us and guests through out. When we went out he will wait for us infront of the door and as soon as he saw out car he will start walking towards the car. He did this until he died two weeks before.  When ever we went to our frends house within our street he will follow us and sit for several hours infront of our friend's house and when we came out he will start walking back towards the house like a dog.  When the end came near he started sleeping in garage and garden and did not come inside the house, not to trouble his masters. So much insight! i wish humans had sense like this.

=== Madrid Revisited (Master) ===
by Sridhar Sarnobat
01 May 2015

It's well known that the first time for anything is always the most memorable. But some things are so enjoyable, you crave a second. Experiencing Atletico Madrid was one such urge.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_T8SIaIV7v8/RnApDKV7HfI/AAAAAAAAAQE/hEW39s8LuH0/s620/Sridhar%2520at%2520Vicente%2520Calderon.jpg

13 years since I sat in the Vicente Calderon (about 20 feet from then-club-president Jesus Gil) I suddenly found myself with the opportunity to revisit my beloved football team's home. 

But this is not just watching a football team play. It's a pilgrimage - a journey seeking to reinforce one's core values. I love Atletico Madrid because it represents the part of me that believes in standing up for yourself against more powerful forces rather than conforming or surrendering.

My club is not the global powerhouse that Real Madrid or Barcelona is. But the most visible brands are not necessarily the most loved. Pizza Hut or Domino's are in more countries, but I pity those masses that haven't tasted SBarro's. They're missing out on something deeper. Actually this analogy isn't really working since SBarro's pizza-by-the-slice is more often thin-crust. But I digress...

In the decade that has lapsed since I watched Atletico climb one of the last rungs out of the second division, things have changed. I no longer live in Europe, but in the San Francisco Bay Area. I traded the Union Jack for the Stars and Stripes and in doing so presumably waived my rights to ever watch a competitive soccer match in person again. 

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dcogUHUSG7g/Rm2H7aV7HGI/AAAAAAAAAM8/Fn3VOzCOgE8/s640/IMG_0128.JPG

Atletico Madrid has been riding a wave of success in recent years, but older fans know that such golden eras are followed by barren years. The club remains fundamentally the same as I last saw it - rich on the outside but still a working-class club at its core. Nothing epitomizes this more than the stadium. The blue glass panels on the exterior have replaced the circus tent-like exterior in a seeming redefinition of the club's identity.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CmTsLtd7_IU/VV6yuf9BDFI/AAAAAAAABlA/TyK0CypjoQ0/s640/2015-04-28%252520069.jpg

But as I walked into the stadium on matchday, which just so happened to be against that other Madrid club you may have heard of in the Champions League, I saw what lied beneath those glass panels. The same old dark dingy concrete concourses, and rusty pipes and stained paint jobs. 

The same paradox could be observed on the field. The club's lineage just continues to be blessed with great players somehow: Aguero, De Gea, Courtois, Falcao, Diego Costa (all of whom now ply their trade in the country of my country of birth). But the man pulling the strings supplements the talent with the same tactics that brought Atletico its short-lived peak in the 1970s. The "vicious bunch of thugs" as dubbed by Celtic fans would be proud of Diego Simeone for instilling a combative style in today's team that saw them achieve the impossible 11 months earlier by winning the league and outlasting Real Madrid and Barcelona who own the worlds two hottest properties in Ronaldo and Messi. Those 2 megastars continue shattering goalscoring records.

But the journey of one other star player of the 2000s has come full circle. I remember in 2002 when I was fortunate enough to be sitting in the VIP section and having access to the backroom area, my Spanish was not quick-witted enough to shout "Fernando, un foto por favor?" at an 18 year old Fernando Torres who walked past me. That tall, talented young star was destined for tremendous highs and also terrible lows. But as he came onto the field to try and break the deadlock against the club he vowed he will never play for, all seems right in this world. He is back at the club where the fans knew he is good and will give him every chance of succeeding. The gleaming look of happiness and assurance like a loved child had resurfaced having been absent since leaving 8 years ago. It was surreal seeing him in my proximity again knowing where all he'd been since he was last in breathing distance of me. He'd won major trophies, experienced long-term injuries, been the subject of huge transfer fees, and divided opinion among fans and .

The match ended 0-0 but I got to brag not only that I'd been to a Madrid derby, but a sold-out Calderon (which isn't a regular occurrence) singing my heart out with 52,000 brothers and sisters. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV_JSvFyd8E

And I managed to get on TV, waving shamelessly to the hard camera in injury time near the flag of India I'd hung above the entrance to the block I'd been sitting in.

I was absolutely exhausted from the travel - acquiring tickets, packing my bags, charging electronic devices, walking across the entire diameter of Madrid's airport, changing Metro stations and limping uphill to my hotel where I promptly crashed for 4 hours (and missed meeting some other foreign fans I'd known over the internet). Only 72 hours earlier I had been in California and had not adjusted to the 9-hour time difference.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Rpx2qCoLy8/VUUFS6InxXI/AAAAAAAABdE/DMNAC8-L9rQ/s512/sleepy.jpg

Seeing a match at the stadium that nestles on the bank of Madrid's Manzanares River was not a new experience - I'd done that in 2002. But what I had been dying to do for the first time didn't happen until the following day: a stadium and museum tour. I wanted to be see with my own eyes the trophies that the club had won in its 111 year history. It was not the biggest collection in the city (that can be seen in the northern half of the city at a bigger stadium), but every trophy was hard-fought for. Heroes had spilt blood, sweat and tears to acquire them. Most trophies were replicas, but one was the original: that League trophy that Atletico had had to wait 3 months to hold after officially winning at the Nou Camp.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E4paVDxarQ4/VUR9spRRsoI/AAAAAAAABcM/w827hSjxI5U/s720/IMG_4338.JPG

The photos in the dressing room with player nameplates will make for an interesting historical snapshot of the club's life, but I couldn't help but wonder how many of these names anyone will have any memories tomorrow. Diego Alonso, Otero, Hibic were all charged with bringing the club back from the 2nd division in 2002, which still seems like yesterday to me. But those names don't ring too many bells in 2015.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nxYtTeGXyGs/VUR-KvI56qI/AAAAAAAABck/NQni_Ra4SyQ/s512/2015-04-28%2520240.jpg

The press conference room had slipped my mind as a forthcoming photo opportunity but I proudly sat in front of the club graphics in a momentary pledge of allegiance.

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vYOHFdvzYNo/VUR9ylfjF1I/AAAAAAAABcU/KmTkMnU4nm0/s720/IMG_4343.JPG

The VIP area which had completely changed from what I'd seen last time. They had moved the museum and wall photos to the uncovered side of the stadium. All that remained was a spacious lobby with marble furniture and bars with dark blue counter tops for the rich and famous. But the most interesting unexpected experience was the player tunnel, which the tour administrators were nice enough to enrich with the Atletio hymn while I was walking through it as happens on matchday.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Lo8sGc_CE

The final spot we tourists were treated to was the dugout. One of them asked "which one is Simeone's seat?" I replied out of turn, "There" pointing at the corner of the dotted box. Simeone isn't one to sit down given the choice (a choice he wasn't given at the start of the season, serving two separate bans simultaneously sitting high in the stands). That drew laughter from people such as a Polish gentleman who kindly helped me capture my memories on camera. 

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_ufbzQ6Ukg/VUR95V_bABI/AAAAAAAABcc/pTfvufC-vFk/s720/IMG_4350.JPG

The club shop had all the expected merchandise though naturally had no historical shirts which is where all my emotion is soaked in (I dream of a store which sells every jersey the club has ever worn - maybe 3D printers will do that one day). I made a point to buy flags with that beautiful Atletico logo which I could proudly display anywhere I felt like displaying my belonging to this club of outlaws, as I'd done the previous night.

=== Marketing - awareness ===
Purchase funnel
* If your brand is strong, not all awareness is good. But if your brand is not well known, any awareness is good
** e.g. you wouldn't put a luxury brand decal on an old car (which is why companies forbid use of their logo that violate their guidebook), but you would put your personal company logo on your old car

Awareness - necessary even if a purchase isn't scheduled
* out of sight out of mind
* latent need?

1) I'm cynical about the true net value of investing time in ...
about some school of thought

2) I don't want to acquire something that I later have to manage

3) So many people of all classes have sacrificed for the advancement of the human race. I've not contributed anything.

4) I wish my activities were decided by a higher authority, with no leeway 
=== Parenting ===
Why should a young person respect their elders if their elders don't respect them?

I always hear people say 'respect your elders', but never 'respect your youngers'.

I have a simple way of thinking, I have absolutley no problem with giving anyone respect provided they show me respect in return. Point blank, simple right. 

Whether your black, white, old, young, gay, straight, bi, chinese, british and so on, if you show me disrespect, you will likely get disrespect in return. 

=== Parenting ===
when your child is young, get a named t-shirt for each of them. They'll love seeing the photos/videos of it when they're older like I do. It's easy for others to be sure that it's me in a photo, and it's more engaging for them
=== Pretty girl approval ===
Sometimes a "loser" boy can handle not being romantically attractive to a pretty girl as long as the girl treats him with respect, not like he's "not good enough" to be a major part of her life.

e.g. Teju and Divya may never have been attracted to me romantically but they depended on me so I felt satisfied.
Saying "I never think of you that way, just as a friend" and not being dependent on the boy is not good enough a showing of respect (e.g. Kavitha M)

=== Understanding my low self esteem ===
Mom (and all women) panic when the future is uncertain and live in fear of it (e.g. me not getting a job in the US). A man or masculine pillar of strength isn't afraid of the uncertainty and is undeterred in his quest to achieve his dream. (Sridhar Sarnobat)
Not sure why her lessons got to me more than lessons by other moms who only have sons. Either it was because of me and my sensitivity, or the force with which my mom made the point.
=== Understanding myself ===
Doctors are not good at sound reasoning. They are very fuzzy (at least my mom is - e.g. she justifies her negative thinking by saying her dad would cross out her homework if she made one mistake. Such intolerance of perfection is toxic in a world where you have to learn by experimenting and not be afraid of making mistakes)
But on the plus side they are a lot more tolerant of human inefficiency than engineers, who get angry if you have to ask them something they allegedyly already told you, or you can get from a source that doesn't involve disturbing them.

=== unglorification ===
Almost all applications can be modelled as compilers. They take some flat text data as input, generate an object model to represent it, do transformations on that model, execute some kind of storage command, and display the output.
=== Unglorification ===
a binary basically a more efficient (size-wise) form of storing plaintext (though that plaintext may not make much semantic sense to humans). Think of the difference between yurl's neo4j storage file versus the mwk file of the same data you want to export from it. The plaintext form doesn't attempt any factoring of repeated patterns so is larger
=== useful rsync info from manpages ===

-b, --backup
With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as each file is transferred or deleted. You can control where the backup file goes and what (if any) suffix gets appended using the --backup-dir and --suffix options.
Note that if you don't specify --backup-dir, (1) the
--omit-dir-times option will be implied, and (2) if --delete is also in effect (without --delete-excluded), rsync will add a lqprotectrq filter-rule for the backup suffix to the end of all your existing excludes (e.g. -f "P *~"). This will prevent previously backed-up files from being deleted. Note that if you are supplying your own filter rules, you may need to manually insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere higher up in the list so that it has a high enough priority to be effective (e.g., if your rules specify a trailing inclusion/exclusion of oq*cq, the auto-added rule would never be reached).
--backup-dir=DIR
In combination with the --backup option, this tells rsync to store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving side. This can be used for incremental backups. You can additionally specify a backup suffix using the --suffix option (otherwise the files backed up in the specified directory will keep their original filenames).
--suffix=SUFFIX
This option allows you to override the default backup suffix used with the --backup (-b) option. The default suffix is a ~ if no --backup-dir was specified, otherwise it is an empty string.
-u, --update


--inplace
This option changes how rsync transfers a file when the file's data needs to be updated: instead of the default method of creating a new copy of the file and moving it into place when it is complete, rsync instead writes the updated data directly to the destination file.

Career paradox
If you're obsessed with computers as a kid your parents are worried it's not a real job so make you feel guilty
If you don't spend enough time using computers when you're young you'll be at a disadvantage in your career.

I didn't have regular access to computers (and limited funds) so didn't get to experiment as much as the other brains (British people who my parents look down on but I think are really smart) who are great with computers.

Then there is another "friend" who will not lose a single attempt of letting me know how happy and successful she is. I'm not a jealous person. I'm really not. I believe that we all have our challenges and lessons to learn. But she is darker than me, overweight than me so she is insecure about it which she tries to mask by putting me down constantly and telling me how she managed to get married, has a child now, has a job, her husband has a really good job and has made the house in her name. Well great. Why are you telling me all this? Did I ever tell you that you won't get any of this or you didn't deserve this? It was all bubbling in your mind under that fake smile. Now its coming out in these snarky comments.

to understand others you have to understand yourself

Being assertive is not the same as being aggressive

You cannot look for validation outside. It needs to come from inside.

With written communication there is no tonality

manager doesn't need to know know how to do all the jobs his employees do
You can ask "how do you do that?" It makes employee feel competent
But manager should be able to identify when employee is doing it wrong
If you have great people, the burden should not be on you to know every little detail.

The buck stops with the manager

You may not be all of the attributes, but you should be on a continuous journey to them

You will be the one who has to explain yourself if you snap ("they only did ..., why is it such a big deal")
Solution: gather as much information as you can (keep records with timestamps). Once you get used to doing it, it will be easy.
If you make a note at the time, it will be more authoritative than when the person denies later on (you can identify inconsistencies)

words are only 7% of the communication volume. Tonality is the other 93%

paraphrase what the other person has said. It makes them feel heard. It also stops you from preparing your response

John Terry and Jamie Carragher walk into a bakery.

John Terry quickly shoves three meat pies in his pocket and walks out.

Outside he says to Jamie,

"Did you see that. The owner hadn't a clue. Nobody can nick things as good as me".

Jamie replies, 

"Wannabet? Come back in the shop and watch this". So they go back in the shop and Jamie says to the Baker,

"Do you wan to see a magic trick?"

The baker, intrigued says,

"Go on them".

Carra says, 

"Give one of those meat pies". The baker passes Jamie a meat pie which he eats really quickly.

"Okay, give me another one" says Jamie which he is passed, and again stuffs it in his mouth and swallows.

"And another" which the bakery dubiously gives him, and which Jamie polishes off in a few seconds.

The baker's a bit peeved now.

"You said you were going to show me a magic trick, all you have done is eat 3 pies".

Jamie smiles knowingly and says,

"Look in Terry's pocket."

that I desperately needed to fart. The place was packed but the music was 
really loud so to get relief and reduce embarrassment I timed my farts to the

After a couple of songs I started to feel much better. I finished my coffee and 
noticed that everyone was staring at me.

Program vs process
A process is a program in execution

elf - executable loadable format

when you execute "ls" everything in the operating system happens
* this is your mental model
* many system calls

system call - a protocol. The way the application interacts with the kernel
e.g. printf

a system call is an entry point to a .h file
Each system call is a proto file (.h).

sockfs	- socket file system

stdin - inode 0
root - inode 2

kernel things are put in /usr
The rest of the directories are not important for this course

tilde ~ is a relic of the old AT & T system

Kernel Source Code organization
/usr/src

Linux is monolythic (except for the loadable kernel module)
The files are very tangled, not tree-like
Small changes have big effects


abi = application binary interface (i.e. system call)
kapi = kernel apis (applications can call these; do not call anything else)
	do not call anything that begins with "__"

innsmod - not part of this course
modprobe

selfie - self explanatory

cpu-load.txt - documentation

semaphore - counting resources
mutex - a degenerate case of the semaphore where the number of resources can only be 1 or 0

2.6.32 - huge change in Linux kernel. It was made renetrant (I think this means that it cannot be prempted by the scheduler)

The txt files must be read before the code makes sense
spinlocks.txt
softirq.c = soft interrupts (irq = interrupt request)

God doesn't doubt himself (privilege level 0)

TLB - Table Lookaside Buffer
	incoherent cache
	
For now, a process and a thread are the same	

IDT - interrupt something table
ISR - interrupt service routine

kernel memory cannot be paged

"stat" gives you the inode number of a file

least significant bits are physical address

don't copy and paste code. Type it out

ELF - executable loadable format

exec - loads a program into memory. A very involved procedure.

exit() is the last thing that a program executes

link-and-loader is part of the operating system

The "beginning" of the kernel space is at the HIGHEST address space

Buddy allocator

Zone hi-mem (executes in privilege level 3)
Zone normal (privilege level 0)

Rings

printk and kmalloc are inconsistently named because different people had different preferences. Get over it.

There are only 2 privilege levels: 0 and 3 (1 and 2 don't exist)

IP = instruction pointer
CS = code segment
DS = data segment
FS - user segment (kernel can references user data via this)
	move EAX, FS[EBX]
		FS - base
		EBX - offsest

The loader decides what the relocated address will be

Linear address

effective/virtual ->  linear -> Physical address

The effective address is set at compile time and doesn't change between executions.

Kernel cannot issue page faults. You'll get kernel panic. The entire kernel must be in memory.

ISR = interrupt service routine

kmalloc - contiguous
vmalloc - not contiguous

In the kernel you may get tlb miss, but never page fault

task = process (interchangeable)

cr3 = privilege level 3

word-align - 2 least significant bits are zeroes

PFA = page fram address

The page table is a bitmap

disking is not the same as swapping

in theory, allocating swap space in memory defeats the purpose

with swapping, you just cherry-pick the dirty pages.

kswapd() - cherry picking to put in swap memory

=== 2014-10-07 UCSC Extension Linux Kernel ===
struct page is fundamental

fork - creates a thread
clone - creates a process

task_struct


The least significant 12 bits (offset) are the same as for the physical address
* I don't see how

IRET - interrupt reexecution
after a page fault has been serviced

CR3 is physical. There's no way to map it to anything virtual, since it IS the map

each process has its own page table (so the process knows its CR3 value)

TLB caches the results of address translation


mem_map struct page*;

page frames are elements of the array of page pointers.


not every page is referenced by a user application. They may be referenced by the hardware(?)
interrupt descriptors
kernel buffers (?)

flags are bitmaps, totalling 32 bits. not 32 bits each

SEARCH: Minimal memory manager
* Tried. Nothing useful :(





==== ====

worst kind of fragmentation in main memory - one page

buddy allocator - orders of 1 page, 2 pages, 4 pages contiguous blocks

realloc()

integrate/coalesce

block = 2 physical page frame numbers

PFN = page frame number (the most significant 20 bits)

too little swappiness will make disk IO huge because there's very little free page frames

"Rob Peter to Pay Paul"

slab, slob, slub

slabs "reserve"/"preallocate" contiguous blocks of memory when you know it's going to be needed.
Reduces fragmentation.
Somewhat analogous to when you create collections and specify an initial size. 
You have some domain specific knowledge that you are anticipating.

kmem_cache_create

slab = slob

slab alloc eventually calls the buddy allocator

PROVERB: Linus Torvalds - maximum security prison guards don't call 911
(i.e. the operating system is playing "god")

KAPIs are only usable by the kernel

systems programming vs kernel programming

when you call kmalloc - check the return code to see if it was allocated successfully.
(this is an emotional scar for the professor)

kmalloc will not use all of the pages in the slab (which is relatively large). So you'll end up with a lot of fragmentation.

Assignment #1
If you had only 16k, how would you conceptualize it in hardware

dmesg - clears kernel buffer

insmod - insert module

lsmod

=== 2014-10-14 UCSC session 4 : Creation And Management ===

System call is the definition of what an application uses.
An operating system agrees to implement those system calls.

Applications are in user space
System Libraries work in user space
Kernel is in kernel space

arch/ implements system calls in different ways

orphan process = zombie process

The parent is responsibility for cleaning up the child process

kswapd

SEARCH: kernel process vs system call

PROVERB: chimpanzee and olympic athlete have 99.999% same DNA. The important differences are small

fork() is one particular parameterization of clone() - specifically clone(SIGCHILD, 0)
Clone is a more generic one
(this is a simplification but for now is useful)

Kernel does not have access to user state, so it needs copyFromUser()
it has to create its own page table (I don't fully get this)

mmap - create a mapping from one process's virtual memory to the other. It is done for one address at a time. Not blocks of memory

each process is a task_struct

we use pointers rather than structs because memory allocation is expensive

You must know what you're looking for in the kernel, from concepts. You cannot just debug the code.

CLONE_FS option - to get an isolated view of the file system? (look up CLONE_FS vs CLONE_FILES)

vfork - for lightweight processes, which do NOT allocate new memory (the slide title has a typo)
No zombies can get created.
(it's similar to aggregation vs composition)

spin locks can never go on the waiting queue, whereas a semaphore can

=== 2014-10-21 UCSC Linux Kernel Architecture 5 ===
List of processes are organized by priority

real time processes have their process's first bit set to 1 (so it's quick to look up)

140 priority levels
	0-99 - real time
	100-139 scheduled

-20 : the least nice process priority

1 bit per list head


hash list = for real time
RB tree = for fair scheduled processes

tree rebalancing is done at the time of insertion
* so you could get the old task back in the next time slice

WHen it comes to pre-emption, a process and thread are not identical


When interrupts are going on you cannot pre-empt
HARDWARE interrupts disable preemption

Interrupts are non-deterministic events

Interrupts need to be processed very fast

CPU clock works by getting a timer interrupt
* specified by number of Hertz (named after a German scientist)

at the bottom of the stack is a thread info struct

pre-empt is not a context switch

ISR cannot be done in user space

real-time timeslices are 100 milliseconds

before kernel 2.6, a process's time slice had to expire. 2.6 onwards allowed pre-emption even if the time slice allocated at the time of scheduling hadn't expired

Toward 2.6.x series of the Linux kernel, an ability to interrupt a task executing kernel code was added, although with that not all sections of the kernel code can be preempted

without pre-emption, a while(true) as a real-time process would hang the system

a kernel schedules resources

timer interrupts are needed to count the amount of time a process has been using the CPU
* You become a non-pre-emptive kernel

interrupts occur in between assembly instructions

when context switching, you're changing the task_struct

Andy Au speaks about TLB problem

Andre Gaitan speaks

	loader of a process generates a linear address. 
	The program has a effective address (that is the same when stored)

	Professor: Effective address - linear address is not easy to understand
	
	http://linuxeco.com/?p=458x
	
	base + effective address = linear address
	
	22 bits in TLB:
	
		INDEX{22} || DATA{10}
		
		TLB[INDEX(22)] -> base address (physical) (32)
		base address (physical) (32) + DATA(10) = physical address
	
	10 bits in TLB:
	
		DATA_MSB{10} || INDEX{10} || DATA_LSB{10}
		
		TLB[INDEX(10)] -> base address least significant bits (22)
		DATA_MSB(10) || base address least significant bits (22) -> base address (physical) (32)
		base address (physical) (32) + DATA_LSB(10) -> physical address	(32)

	To check if there's a TLB miss, compare the tag with the 10 most significant bits. If there is a miss, walk the page tables

With ANY software, but especially the OS kernel, you need to understand the concepts

There's no way to interactively debug the kernel. Only dmesg. But even that may not work.

You can debug functionality but not performance.

You have to be very persistent when working on kernel. And you have to be thick skinned. Not necessarily smart.

If you are a "nice" person, stay with application development 

PROVERB: "emotion that is misplaced becomes criminal logic"

==== ====
in interrupt context or system call we cannot be pre-empted (because we would not save the registers)

top half - immediate. hard IRQ. hardware? Synchronous.
bottom half - deferred. soft IRQ. software? Asynchronous.

IRQ = interrupt request

Aggregated - because many such requests may come in

This deferred processing pattern is common in large scale software development

ISR = interrupt service routine

processing softirq disables preemption because we are clobbering registers

BUT we don't want to disable interrupts while processing softirqs

you have to be out of soft and hard IRQ processing to enable preemption

Problem Statement
Introduction
To answer this question
???	To evaluate the attractiveness of competing in the DRAM industry, we conduct a Porter???s 5 Forces analysis.
???	The advantages the Chinese entrants are seeking, the means by which they intend to achieve it, and how this will affect the industry, is explored with a Value Chain Analysis.


=== Balanced scorecard Book notes ===
Customer objective of ???Lowering complaints.???

Customer perspective. An objective of ???Lower return rates??? in the Customer perspective of a retail outlet may lead to ???Work with ???A???-rated suppliers??? in the Internal Process perspective.

We will execute our strategy of operational efficiency by lower- ing costs, increasing loyalty, reducing rework, and closing skills gaps.

Try and limit the number of objectives to a maximum of three per each Scorecard perspective.

Your Balanced Scorecard should contain a mix of leading and lagging indicators

Lag indicators:
* Market share
??? Sales
??? Employee satisfaction

Coming up with the lagging measures probably will not pose much of a challenge since our measurement language is awash in such indicators: sales, profits, satisfaction, and many others are common measures in use today. It is perfectly appropriate to feature a number of these lagging indicators on your Scorecard

your leading indicators are what set you apart by identifying the specific activities and processes you believe are critical to driving those lagging indicators of success

The Balanced Scorecard should contain a mix of lag and lead measures of performance.

A number of issues relating to financial measures were discussed:
??? They are not consistent with today???s business environment in which most value is created by intangible assets.

most or- ganizations choose financial measures related to three areas: growth, prof- itability, and value creation.

Gross margin, net income, and profit as a percentage of sales are all typically used.

Customer satisfaction, market share, retention, and cus- tomer profitability 

To develop a customer value proposition, many organizations choose one of three ???disciplines???
Operational excellence.
Product leadership.
Customer intimacy. 

They don???t look for one-time transactions but instead focus on long-term re- lationship building through their deep knowledge of customer needs.

make hard choices to stay ahead of the competition: ???less product variety, the courage not to please every customer, forging the whole company, not just manufacturing and distribution, into a single focused instrument.

???Product availability,??? ???inventory turnover,??? and ???stockouts??? would be closely moni- tored.

Customer-intimate organizations recognize that their clients have needs beyond which their product alone can satisfy.

???training hours on client products.??? 
???total number of solutions offered per client.???
???share of tar- geted customer spending.???
???Percentage of employees with access to customer information???
???Number of customer awards received???
???Number of staff at client locations??? 
???hours spent with customers???
???number of referrals received from existing customers???

could monitor transaction ease by exam- ining the number of fields into which the customer must enter informa- tion or the number of abandoned transactions.

appy employees really do drive finan- cial success a

employees must have the ability to manipulate knowledge through the use of physical and nonphysical tools. 

Track the percentage of employees who meet their personal development plan goals. Don???t make it an an- nual measure. To motivate action on this important task, ask employees for quarterly or even monthly progress updates. 

attempting to offer employ- ees an environment that facilitates and encourages them to adopt bet- ter lifestyles.

encourage trained employees to share their newfound knowledge with their peers and networks in the company. Experts call this third person teaching and suggests that it offers many benefits to both the student and the teacher. For example, know- ing you will have to share what you???re learning will motivate most people to pay greater attention and capture more of the information they are receiving.

Strategy implies the movement of an organization from its present position to a desirable but uncertain future position.

Without this series of connections, you are left with nothing more than an ad-hoc collection of financial and nonfinancial measu

====   ====

The CR3 register points to the page directory
PDE tells us which page directory entry points to our page table entries, and PTE tells us which page table entry points to our page table.

//If the TLB is only 1KB in size, this means our pages can only be up to 1KB in size. Bigger page tables are better because they avoid frequent I/O which is costly (excessively large I/O would be counterproductive too, but 1KB I/O is relatively small).

Most processors only support 4KB (x 1024 bytes per KB = 4096 bytes) sized pages. To address any of these 4096 byte locations in hardware, we need 12 bits words (because 2^12 = 4096).
Therefore, the 12 least significant bits of a linear address are reserved for physical page offsets.
(but what I don't get is whether we only address every 4th memory location)

Of the 32 bits in each address, 20 remain available for identifying the page whose offset will determine the exact location of the byte in a page. This allows us to uniquely identify 1,048,576 different pages.

If each page's physical address was to be obtained from the TLB, the TLB would have to store 1,048,576 memory addresses - each 32 bits long. Therefore, the TLB would have to be 4,194,304 bytes large (4 MB).

However, we are restricted to 1 KB by our hardware designers for economic reasons. Therefore, we can only store the addresses of 256 pages (because each entry occupies 4 bytes). Since each page is 4 KB in size, this means that we are able to address 1024 KB of memory.



This requires 10 bits of the 20 that comprise our page identifier (since 2^10 = 1024). Therefore, the 10 least significant bits above the 12 bits that comprise the page offset are used to address one of the 1024 entries in the reduced size TLB. This makes it possible to address 4 MB of memory (because 2^(12+10) = 4194304).

-------

One page gives us 4KB of memory for our data. (calculation not shown)

To address all of these 4K of byte locations we need the 12 least significant bits.




------

We need an additional 8 bits to expand the addressable space to 1GB


This will only allow us to address  4024 KB / 1024 ^ 3 of the memory we need to.

Therefore, we need 1024^2/4 page table entries (262144 page table entries).

This requires 20 bits


-------
8 bits = 1 byte
1 KB = 1024 bytes = 128 entries each of size 32 bits (4 bytes)
1 MB = 1024 x 1024 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes
1 GB = 1024 x 1024 x 1024 = 1,073,741,824 bytes = 268,435,456 entries each of size 32 bits (4 bytes) = 

2^28 = 268,435,456


In a vanilla TLB, we would require 


==== ====


The most significant 10 bits will not be translated but stored verbatim, and constitute the most significant 10 bits of the physical address.

This will allow us to address 4 MB * 2^10 memory locations = 4 GB.

Signals are like chords you can pull on a process

A segmentation fault means you have tried to access a memory segment that is not in your process's memory segment range.

wait() - waits for child to terminate

signal() - RESPOND to a signal

sigaction() is supposed to replace signal() but you need to manipulate a struct

wait() is a blocking call

A signal works a lot like a software interrupt (but in a software interrupt it is for 2 USER processes to communicate)

There is no SIGKILL handler in a program because the kernel takes care of that (though there can be optional cleanup on killing)
* cleanup will not occur.

Killing a process won't cause its children to be killed. They get reparented.

PROVERB: A parent has to clean up its toys after a child has played

strace

everything in strace before getpid() is part of bash.exe. getpid() is part of the get_pid binary

strace won't work with multiple threads. gdb was built for this purpose

The POSIX standard doesn't state that strace must be straceable, though Linux implements it.

We need 34 bits to address 16GB of memory (2^34)
	2^34 = 1,717,986,9184
20 bits can address 1GB of memory (2^20)
	2^20 = 1,048,576
10 bits can address 1K of memory (2^10)
	2^10 = 1024

when a TLB miss occurs

TLB = accessed by hardware
Page table = accessed by software

The TLB is basically a cache of the page directory within the processor (reducing access time by 10 times). Walking the page directory (which resides in main memory) is expensive.

Processors have improved in performance at a much greater rate than memory performance (not necessarily size)

Loadable kernel module is part of the kernel in the same way that a static module is

Abstraction is not useful at a kernel development level.


for strings in lkm you need to kmalloc space

You don't have to copy data from user space to the kernel. You can just pass the memory address.

The parent thread may process the signal instead of the child (which is a problem, and we did nothing wrong). It's implementation specific. You have to play around with the timing to get it right.
Moral of the story: signals are hard.

call - takes you to a more privileged level
return - takes you to a less privileged level

linker and loader set the address of function calls (compiler)

int 0x80 = call to a software interrupt.

Interrupt descriptor table indexes:
14 = page fault
80 = software interrupt

eax stores the system call number

before jumping to a specific routine, the sys_call wrapper needs to save all the registers

System call table (not to be confused with the interrupt descriptor table)

TLB problem Problem Statement


We have a 32 bit architecture.
Our Translation Lookaside Buffer only has 10 bits.
	Correction: there are 2^10 (i.e. 1024) entries in the TLB
We want to be able to address 1GB of memory. 
We have a PDE and PTE base address.

TLB is a non-coherent structre (it may something is valid when it isn't) - because it's not tied to memory

pre-emption - process switch
interrupt - ?

spin lock does a busy-wait (unlike mutex/semaphores)

mutex is a degenerate case for a semaphore (0 or 1)

you cannot sleep in an interrupt context

You only return failure when the semaphore is available again because it will waste CPU cycles (if you returned failure before sleeping then we're effectively busy waiting)

The spin lock stalls.

spin lock gets transmitted over a bus, which acts like a network

call schedule() to resume task execution in the future

up - uniprocessor
smp - symmetric multiprocessor

when there are multiple processors, the other ones must busy-wait rather than sleep wait (via a semaphore)

multiple processors can concurrently access the struct semaphore.

spin locks are not a linux thing. They're an Intel thing and have been around forever. They're hardware locks.
Spin lock used to be a no op. That's no longer the case.


file system features you introduce will always have to be backward compatible. You cannot remove them later because people will have created files with them.


myproc is in kernel space, not user space. That requires another layer

When an extremely excited cat sees his tail moving, he may treat it as prey or find it extremely annoying that he needs to do something about it, thus he goes after it.

Raul Garcia's spell is quite the narrative. He joined us in 2007, the same summer we sold Torres. We had finished 7th in the league and had not played a European fixture for 7 years (except Intertoto cup). In his first season we qualified for the Champions League and would play European competition for his 8 full seasons with us. And of course, we won all those trophies. I just hope this isn't a symbolic end of the golden era.

2015-08-30 Atletico faced a daunting trip to reigning Europa League champions Sevilla, enjoying their fourth triumph in the competition in 10 seasons and narrowly losing a goal-laden Supercup against Barcelona 19 days earlier. Atletico reproduced the unity that saw them lift the Primera Liga trophy 365 days earlier (3 months after winning it). Raul Garcia was a notable absentee, on the verge of leaving to join Athletic Bilbao. The players and bench celebrated the 2nd and 3rd league goals by raising 8 fingers, acknowledging the Basque's shirt number and his tenure (coincidentally, 8 years) at Atletico Madrid that coincided with Atletico's golden era. Atletico would suddenly be facing life without their bearded midfield pair of Raul Garcia and Arda Turan.

Stadium Metropolitano de Madrid
0 Memories





Key facts

Club: Club Atlético de Madrid | Opening: 1923 | Closing: 1966 | Final capacity: 58,000

Description

Stadium Metropolitano was for over 40 years the home of Club Atlético de Madrid until the club moved in 1966 to Estadio Vicente Calderón.

In its first decade of existence Atlético had played at various makeshift grounds until the club moved in 1913 to Campo de O’Donnell, not to be confused with the stadium with the same name that Real Madrid occupied at that time.

However, Atlético’s ambitions soon outgrew Campo de O’Donnell and a piece of land was bought in the north of the city near the Avenida de la Reina Victoria. The plot was strategically chosen as it lay not far from the newly opened metro station Cuatro Caminos on Madrid’s first metro line, though the club would also build an additional electric tramway to connect the metro station with the stadium.

The site of the proposed stadium already had the natural shape of an amphitheatre and therefore only one proper stand had to get built to complement the earth banks which served as terraces.

Stadium Metropolitano officially opened on the 13th of May 1923 and an estimated 20,000 people witnessed Atlético beating Real Sociedad 2-1.

The capacity of the stadium was initially about 25,000, though another 20,000 could witness the games for free from elevated places outside the stadium. The architect had been José María Castell, who would go on to design Real Madrid’s Campo de Chamartín, which would open one year later not far from the Stadium Metropolitano.

In 1929 the stadium was the site of the England national team’s first loss outside of the British Islands. Spain sent the English home with a 4-3 defeat.

In the late 1930s the stadium got severely damaged during the Spanish Civil War. For a few years Atlético was forced to play its home matches at other grounds, but then made use of the opportunity to thoroughly rebuilt the Metropolitano, which included the construction of proper terraces at the ends where before were mere earth banks.

Stadium Metropolitano reopened on the 21st of February 1943 with a match against Real Madrid (2-1). The renovated stadium counted with a capacity of 35,800, which soon however turned out to be too small again. In the early 1950s the pitch was therefore dug out and an additional lower tier was added, which raised capacity to about 58,000 places.

However, by that time the stadium had already significantly aged and more modern stadiums were built elsewhere in Spain, not the least Real’s Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. It therefore did not take long for Atlético to start making plans too, and in the early 1960s a plot of land was bought on the southern edge of the city on the banks of the Rio Manzaneras.

While Atlético’s proposed new stadium was technically closer to Madrid’s city centre than the Metropolitano, the city had until then mostly grew northwards and many Atlético fans protested against moving to the edge of the city. The current protests of moving to Estadio La Peineta may therefore for the older fans seem like a deja vu.

Estadio Vicente Calderón finally opened in October 1966 and the abandoned Stadium Metropolitano got soon after demolished and replaced by residential buildings.

Nuevo Estadio Atlético de Madrid
 




Key facts

Club: Club Atlético de Madrid | Capacity: 70,000 | Scheduled opening: n/a | Status: under construction

Description

Nuevo Estadio Atlético de Madrid is the currently under construction new stadium of Atletico Madrid and as such will replace their current Estadio Vicente Calderón, which lacks the possibilities for expansion and modernisation being enclosed by a river and a motorway on one side and residential buildings on the other.

Concrete plans for the stadium were presented in late 2011, then still in combination with a Madrid bid for the 2020 or 2024 Olympics. While the stadium was designed as a football-specific stadium with the stands close to the pitch, plans allowed for the temporary construction of an athletics tracks on top of the lower tier.

The stadium is getting built on the site of the current Estadio La Peineta, an athletics stadium with one large concrete stand. Parts of that stand have been incorporated in the design of the new stadium, while the rest will be demolished. The costs of the project are estimated to be €200 million, which will be financed by the development of the land on which the Vicente Calderón currently stands. Atlético Madrid will become the sole owner of the stadium.

Estadio La Peineta is located in the east of the city of Madrid, just over 8 kilometres from Madrid’s city centre and not far from Barajas International Airport. It lies almost adjacent to the M-40 motorway and already has two metro stations in its vicinity.

Initial works started quickly after the club announced its plans in 2011, but have progressed slowly since. In the middle of 2014, most foundation works had been completed and a start had been made with the construction of the lower tier. The club had set an estimated completion date for 2015, but are unlikely to make that deadline.

Estadio Vicente Calderón

Key facts

Club: Club Atlético de Madrid | Opening: 1966 | Capacity: 54,960 seats

History and description

Estadio Vicente Calderón was built in the 1960s as the replacement for Atlético’s then-home Stadium Metropolitano.

Stadium Metropolitano had been the home of Atlético since 1923, but had significantly aged and rivals Real Madrid had just opened the new Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.

Land was bought on the southern edge of the city on the banks of the river Manzaneras, and while this land was technically closer to Madrid’s centre than the Metropolitano, many fans still objected to a site that was deemed outside of the city.

Estadio Vicente Calderón officially opened on the 2nd of October 1966 with a league match between Atlético and Valencia (1-1), though construction of the main stand had not been finished yet due to funding problems.

The stadium was finally completed in 1970, and then counted with a capacity of 62,000 seats and no standing areas, which made Estadio Vicente Calderón the first large all-seater stadium in Europe.

The stadium had initially been called Estadio de Manzaneras, but its name was changed in 1971 in honour of  club-president Vicente Calderón, who had overseen the construction of the stadium.

Estadio Vicente Calderón was selected as one of the playing venues of the 1982 World Cup, during which it hosted three second-round group matches.

The stadium has changed little over the years, and only received a few refurbishments that included the installation of the red-white-and-blue seats, which also reduced capacity somewhat.

In 2011, Atlético announced plans to replace Estadio Vicente Calderón with a new stadium at the site of Estadio de la Peineta in the east of the city. Atlético stated the ambition to move into their new home in 2015, but works have progressed very slowly and the time schedule is currently unclear.

Getting there

Estadio Vicente Calderón is located on the south-western edge of Madrid’s city centre, on the banks of the river Manzaneras and along the M-30 motorway which runs underneath the main stand.

The stadium is an approximate 30 minutes walk from Plaza Mayor, and even less from Madrid’s Palacio Real, from where it is an almost straight walk south.

The closest metro station is Pirámides, from where it is a 10-minute walk to the stadium. Pirámides lies on metro line 5, which crosses right through Madrid’s centre (e.g. stops Ópera, Callao, and Gran Via). Metro station Marques de Vadillo, also on line 5, but on the other side of the river, lies a 15-minute walk away from the stadium.

Pirámides station is also served by Cercanía commuter trains. Line C-7 and C-10 connect the stadium with, among others, train stations Atocha and Chamartín.

Eat, drink, and sleep

Estadio Vicente Calderón is located in a rather quiet urban neighbourhood, though not far away from the southern edge of Madrid’s city centre. There are a few bars and restaurants around, but it might be easier to eat or drink in the centre and then walk or take a metro to the stadium.

If you wish to stay as close as possible to Estadio Vicente Calderón, then Hotel NH Ribera de Manzanares will be your pick. It lies almost adjacent to the stadium, gets good reviews, and a room costs about €100.00 per night. The Holiday Inn Pirámides is only a little further away, but also more affordable.

Staying in the southern part of the city centre may be a better option if you want to include some sightseeing or head into the nightlife. Hotel Puerta de Toledo, Hotel Gavinet, and HRC Hotel get good reviews, are reasonably affordable, and no more than 15 minutes walking from either the stadium or the Plaza Mayor.

Tickets

Tickets for Atlético games can be bought online, by phone +34 902 530 500, via the Servicaixa cash points, or at the ticket windows of the stadium from a few days before the match.

Tickets are also available on the gate before the start of the match. Atlético’s attendances are among the highest in the Primera División, but they do not tend to sell out more than one or two home matches per season.

Ticket prices depend on the opponent, but generally start at €30.00 for an upper-tier seat behind the goal and range up to €80.00 for a central seat at the main stand.

You can find a seating plan here (pdf).

The Estadio Metropolitano had a difficult start to life as a stadium. It was inaugurated on 13 May 1923, when a crowd of 25,000 saw Atlético beat Real Sociedad by two goals to one. However, it was not universally popular to start with and over the course of the next 20 years, a series of disputes and the Civil War saw Atlético criss-cross across Madrid, before finally settling back at the Metropolitano in 1943. The first league match was  played on Sunday 17 February 1929, with the visitors Real Sociedad winning 0-3. The club finally called it a day in September 1966, moving south to the Estadio Vicente Calderon. You can read about the Metropolitano here.

Messi would come off the bench to get a deserved winner and his first goal of the seasonagainst the team he has scored more goals against than any other club. Simeone would admit Barcelona's superiority all over the pitch after the game, though in truth it was underwhelming  by the visitor's standards.

- don't search the web

The home of the Indians

Everyone knows of this football temple but not many know the story behind it. To get to know the legendary Vicente Calder??n stadium, we have to go back to the very beginnings of the club.

The first ground that the Colchoneros used was situated on the south side of Madrid and it was called Ronda de Vallecas. It was used in the first decade of Atletico???s history.



The club moved to it???s new stadium, Campo de O???Donnell, in 1913. The first game played in their new home was against Athletic Bilbao. Maximum number of spectators was 10000 and it was, at that time, one of the most modern stadiums in the country.

Certainly the biggest and the most legendary of all former grounds is the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid which was used from 1923 until 1966 when it was demolished (the club used Estadio de Vallecas ???39-???43 because Metropolitano was destroyed in the Civil war). It was also the first stadium that Atletico played in as a independent football club!



It was 17 March 1961 when Javier Barroso bought a piece of land near the Manzanares river. On that very land, 5 years later, stood a newly built grand stadium that could recieve up to 62000 spectators. Estadio Manzanares was officially inaugurated on 2 October 1966 in a match against Valencia that ended 1-1.

In the early 70s, the stadium was closed for reconstruction, but when its gates were opened again on 23 May 1972 its capacity was reduced and it had a new name: Estadio Vicente Calder??n, after the club???s president.

Another reconstruction was made before the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

Now the stadium has capacity for 54,960 spectators and is classified a 5 Star UEFA Elite Stadium.

2016-05-08 Bowed out of the title race after beginning so well against already-relegated Levante with Torres' opening goal with less than 2 minutes on the clock. An equalizer before half time was the deadly blow, and forced the team to pour forward in search of a goal which left them open at the back and ultimately they conceded in the 88th minute. Simeone's touchline ban, unlike in other games, proved important.

2016-05-14 Torres opened the scoring with a bicycle kick from a corner. He hit the cross bar with another overhead attempt which Griezmann bundled in from the rebount.

Oblak equalled a domestic record of goals conceded, 18, by Deportivo La Coruna in 1994.
===  ===

2016-04-30 Griezmann, being kept in reserve for the Bayern return leg came on as a substitute and found the net within 40 seconds.

2016-04-27 Oblak's 23 clean sheets was a new club record, breaking Courtois' twenty 2 years earlier. Both sides hit the woodwork in the 2nd half, Torres doing so for the home side. Torres had scored 3 times in Champions League semi finals, including once against the visiting manager at the Nou Camp and once against his current team. Again Atletico were restricted to 31% possession, reminiscent of the match against Guardiola's previous club. Gaurdiola was known to be on his way out to take over Man City, who he could well have faced in the final. Oblak continued to look assured with routine stops that he was not distracted from making in the extreme pressure of the stage.

===  ===

2016-04-23 Against Malaga the same nerves and stalemate emerged as 2 years ago. However, an hour into the game a deflection from substitute Correa's long-range effort broke the deadlock to lift the huge weight off the players shoulders, and kept the pressure on Barcelona while maintaining the slender 1 point advantage over Real. The substitute could have added a second on 77 minutes with another shot from distance but failed to hit the target. But he was continuing to show his starmaking qualities, reminding fans that Carrasco was not the only player who added directness to attack. Felipe Luiz's heroics at both ends also proved that 2nd comings aren't always failures. Torres would not add to his run of scoring in 5 successive league games - the best in his career. He had a glorious chance with one of the last kicks of the game but gave an untimely reminder that he was still not the Fernando Torres of 10 years earlier.
===  ===
18 goals conceded 93-94 season - Depor. Atletico on 16 as of match day 34.
===  ===

2016-04-13 Again UEFA mandated both teams play in their away strips. 73% possession for Barcelona in the first 45 minutes only yielded 1 shot on target for them. Atletico grabbed the lead as they did 2 years ago and as they did 3 times earlier this season. Barcelona had gone 39 games in all competitions unbeaten until the Clasico defeat. A looping header early in the 2nd half by Lucas Hernandez hit the bar. Barcelona began to pile on the pressure just before the hour mark to keep themselves in the competition (with Atletico leading on away goals) with Atletico camped in their own final 3rd. At one point the 2nd half possession stats read 82% to the visitors. In the 84th minute Koke got away with a possible handball. 2 minutes later Felipe Luiz's burst forced a handball by Iniesta (which in truth was worthy of a red card). Griezmann tucked away the the resulting penalty to knock the holders out, capping another epic triumph. The drama was not over as the ball struck Godin's upper back-stretched arm inside the penalty area but the referee gave as a free kick. Messi's miss was greeted with a roar as great as a goal itself for the home side, knowing that they were inches away from being taken to extra time. Atletico had put in a defensive masterclass to reach the semifinal.

Simeone
2016-04-13 “I would look beyond the fact that we have reached a semi-final to values which are ever rarer in society,” Simeone said. “We can win or lose but we believe in the values life teaches you: respect, perseverance, the willingness to get up again, the ability to persist even against those more talented, to compete. I said to the players: you have great values as individuals and as a group. We never stopped believing.”
===  ===

2016-04-02 Betis at home on a sun-drenched spring afternoon, the score was opened by Fernando Torres showing clinical finishing that hadn't been seen in years. He continued his excellent 2016 form. The second goal scored by Griezmann was a lob pass that was bizarrely evaded by the goalkeeper who was expecting Koke to touch the ball (coming from an offside position and interfering with play it should have been chalked off). Oblak continued to show outstanding reflexes tipping a header onto the post early in the second half. Felipe Luiz delighted with a beautiful piece of skill around the 67th minute. Betis goalkeeper Adrian pulled off some great saves to keep the scoreline down for the majority of the match. Substitute Tomas would hit the post. Oblak made an uncharacteristic mistake spilling a hopeful ball into the box that bounced awkwardly in front of him allowing Betis to sow the seeds of a possible comeback. Thomas would not be denied his goal scoring in injury time with more tireless work by Griezmann (who'd scored a beautiful free kick at the Amsterdam Arena 8 days earlier for his country). Later in the day Real would pull off an unexpected come-from-behind win at the Nou Camp that meant Atletico had closed the gap from 9 to 6 points, with Real staying 1 point behind Atletico.

2016-03-15 Eliminated Cocu's Eredivisie table toppers PSV. PSV almost took the lead and an away goal but hit the upright in an open goalless 90 minutes. Atletico started to outdo the opposition in extra time but remained goalless. The penalties were excellently taken by PSV and Atletico had some close shaves. Torres, who'd had an excellent game had to score the 5th penalty to keep his boyhood club in the competition - and did in a moment of extreme nerves that the fondo norte were agonizing over. The tension could be seen in the Atleti players post-strike celebrations.

2016-03-13 Depor had lost on their last 9 visits to the Calderon, and the last player to score for them against Atletico was Felipe Luiz.

2016-03-06 Torres continued his mini revival while halting Gary Neville's mini revival at Valencia, 11 years after El Nino scored the winner against Rafael Benitez's Che.

2016-02-27 - Inflicted Zidane's first defeat, with Atletico having exerted themselves in the Netherlands on Wednesday while Real had had the midweek free (their CL round of 16 first leg was scheduled for the following week). Felipe Luiz's darting support run and some all round show of skill and finishing from Griezmann extended Atletico's unbeaten league run in the derby to 6 games. The Frenchman marked the moment with the iconic archer celebration that Kiko, and later Torres, had once posed with. The result ended any realistic hopes of 3rd placed Real catching Barcelona, while keeping Atletico's very faint hopes alive. No club had previously won 3 consecutive times in the league at the Bernabeu.

What a gentleman....and the Torres that I really like..."No-one comes before Atletico Madrid, that is what matters most."

Oh the mighty football god, if you are up there listening to me, please perform a miracle somehow for Torres to stay.........

The former Chelsea man is open about his desire to stay at the Vicente Calderon when his current deal expires in the summer

Fernando Torres has admitted he expects to leave Atletico Madrid in the summer with Diego Simeone's side having failed to offer the striker a contract.

Goal understands Atleti have opted against signing the striker on a permanent deal when his 18-month loan deal from AC Milan expires at the end of the season.

Torres' return to Atletico has been a disappointment with the former
Liverpool and Chelsea striker managing just eight goals in 50
appearances in all competitions.

The 31-year-old admits he has discussed his future with Simeone and is not optimistic about remaining at the Vicente Calderon.

"What we talked about was personal and that's the way I’d like to keep it," he told reporters at a sponsorship event in Madrid.

"The transfer window closes tonight and there's no offer on the
table. But there's always the summer. I've never hidden my desires but
it's not up to me. I know my job is to score goals and that's what all
us forwards have to do.

"We have a professional relationship and have admiration for each
other. I'm eternally grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to
come back to Atletico. He knows that I give it my all to play every
match, that's what I train for. Simeone is extremely important to this
club and my admiration for him will continue to be the same."

Torres also insisted the lack of a new deal will not affect his motivation for the rest of the season under Simeone.

"There are no hard feelings. I’m 31-years-old, I'm not a child anymore. I don't take these decisions personally," he added.

"This is the time for unity, there's no need to focus on anything
else. Things go better when the fans, the technical staff and the team
are united. No-one comes before Atletico Madrid, that is what matters
most."

Torres joined Atletico as an 11-year-old and captained the club at
19, before leaving for Liverpool in 2007. He insists Simeone's decision
does not alter his affection for the club.

"It doesn't change a thing. Since returning my goal has always been
to win with Atleti and that's still the case regardless of the
situation. I'm taking it one game at a time to accomplish what I set out
to do," he added.

"I'm taking things one day at a time and am delighted to be playing
for the team I love. I'm sad not to be on the pitch with my team-mates
obviously, but I'm taking things as they are. My only wish is to get
back into the starting line-up, play and savour every game I have in
this jersey."

Angel Correa: Atletico's star in the making who conquered tragedy and heart surgery

Jorge Sattore profiles one of the latest additions to Argentina's fiercesome frontline, who overcame cardiac surgery to reach the top...
The 60-second story  
FACT FILE
Date of birth: March 9, 1995
Place of birth: Rosario (Argentina)
Height: 5ft 8in
Position: Forward
Club: Atletico Madrid (14 apps, 2 goals)
Former club(s): San Lorenzo 
International: Argentina (3 caps, 1 goal)
Argentine Angel Correa's story is an inspiring one. Brought up in one of Rosario’s most deprived areas, a young Angel was aware his streets were flooded with drugs and crime. However, his only drug was that of effort and a willingness to keep on improving. 
By the age of 12, he had already suffered two immense tragedies: the death of his father and brother. Nevertheless, that didn't shatter his dream of becoming a professional footballer, so he moved to Buenos Aires to play for San Lorenzo’s youth ranks. Things went well; Correa appeared in the 2011 youth championship and finally made his debut at 18 in the Argentine Primera Division under the management of Juan Antonio Pizzi, who would later lead Valencia.
The next season, the young tricky player surprised everyone by contributing significantly as the capital team won the title. In May 2014, the then-19-year-old agreed to sign for Atlético Madrid, although the deal wasn't made official until December, when he transferred for £6 million. But during his Colchoneros medical it was discovered that the Argentine had a heart tumour, and he subsequently underwent microsurgery in New York.

Correa
Correa made his senior debut for Argentina in September
The operation was successful, and despite a hugely difficult period, Correa was back in action six months later at the South American youth championship. There, he helped Argentina to win the title and was named player of the tournament. Discussing his operation and recovery, the youngster said: “When I had the heart operation I was not afraid. I said to myself ‘I am with anaesthesia, if I wake up then good, but if I don’t then it’s my time’.”
In August 2015 he made his official Atlético Madrid debut, and a few weeks later the 20-year-old pulled on his national team's shirt for the first time.

- Angel Correa
Atlético are well known for consistently bringing through world-class strikers; Christian Vieri, Fernando Torres, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Sergio Agüero, Diego Forlan, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa to name some of the players that Atleti fans have been able to enjoy in recent times.
However, this season Diego Siemone has more at his disposal up front. Jackson Martinez, Torres, Antoine Griezmann, Luciano Vietto are Yannick Ferreira Carrasco are vying for contention, but Correa has been among those having the biggest impact. The young Argentine has only contributed two goals and an assist so far, but has already won over Rojiblancos fans who appreciate his nifty footwork and exciting style.

Strengths
The Rosarino has a low centre of gravity, which makes him a very difficult player to defend against. He also possesses excellent technique, speed and something very important to any good attacking player: a great first touch.
However, his key attribute that sometimes goes under the radar is his mental strength. The difficult issues Correa has faced throughout his life have turned him into someone who never gives up. His work rate and unceasing tenacity are clear.

Weaknesses 
The most obvious weakness is his lack of height, at just 5ft 8in, and as such isn't a player likely to get on the end of set-pieces. The other big weakness comes again from his physicality – even though his low centre of gravity makes him an elusive attacker, it also means that he can struggle against physically powerful opposition.
They said…
Tata Martino, the Argentina manager, holds Correa in very high regard. He said: "Correa is impressive. I see a guy who has no fear, who does what he feels.
"Calling him into the squad is very exciting. Sometimes it’s confusing where he’s playing. He’s a player with a half-defined position. I’m not that interested in where he plays. He has the capacity for goals and he’s another option already."

Did you know?
His professional debut with San Lorenzo was against Rosario-based Newell’s Old Boys, who he has always supported.

Correa Real
The Argentine has helped Atleti stay ahead of city rivals Real
What happens next?
“
He is ready. Everything that is happening to him is not a coincidence. He’s courageous, he’s not scared of anything and he has new heart, as well as being a fantastic player.
- Diego Simeone
Atlético chief Simeone has liked what he's seen from his young attacker so far. "He is ready," declared El Cholo. "Everything that is happening to him is not a coincidence. He’s courageous, he’s not scared of anything and he has new heart, as well as being a fantastic player."
Simeone's men are enjoying an exciting season, even if they squandered the chance to top La Liga last time out against Malaga. They remain second ahead of city rivals Real Madrid, however, and have the quality to go far in the Champions League. On the other side of the world, Argentina have started World Cup qualifying inauspiciously and need to start winning matches soon to avoid the risk of missing out in Russia. Correa will surely play a big part.

=== Fifteen years after his first, Fernando Torres brings up his Atlético century ===

It was 2001 when Fernando Torres scored his first goal for Atlético Madrid and, with his future at the club uncertain, he finally scored his 100th this weekend

Save for later -->

Manuel Briñas is 84, wears dark spectacles and has a thin white moustache to go with his hair. He lives in the residency of a Catholic school in the north of Madrid, walks with the help of a crutch hooked over one arm and spends every other weekend at the Vicente Calderón, standing alone watching Atlético play from among the photographers, technicians and stewards behind the advertising boards. At the end of each game he heads quietly out through the tunnel that leads to the cark park under the north stand where the media wait for the players, cameras ready and microphones in hand.

This Saturday, they waited for him. Like the immense majority of those who do the job he does, as important as they are anonymous, Briñas normally goes unnoticed but this time was different. He had started his slow walk along the edge of the pitch but someone there was looking for him, which meant that soon everyone was looking at him. “I was heading home when I felt a tap on the shoulder,” he explained, voice breaking. “I turned and it was Fernando [Torres]. He whispered in my ear: ‘This is for you, you made me love these colours. I’ll be grateful to you for the rest of my life.’”

At the end of their 3-1 win over Eibar, Torres’s team-mates had applauded the fans and gone down the players’ tunnel on the west side of the stadium where the Manzanares and the motorway pass, but Torres had headed north instead, towards Briñas. “I was looking for him, making sure he didn’t leave; luckily he didn’t escape,” he said. When he got there, behind the goal, beyond the hoardings, watched by the fans, he embraced Briñas, pulled off his shirt and handed it to him. “No one would feel prouder to have it than him,” Torres explained. “He’s responsible for me being here; he’s the one who said I could do it.”

Torres first met Briñas two decades ago. He was 10 and, accompanied by his dad and his brother Isra, he had turned up – two hours early – for a trial with 200 other kids on the gravel pitches of the Parque de las Cruces in Carabanchel, Atlético territory. It was not long after Jesús Gil had disbanded the youth system, losing Raúl as a result, and now Briñas was trying to rebuild it from scratch. They played 11-a-side games split into 20-minute halves while the coaches gave marks out of 10. “Give him 10,” Briñas said when he saw Torres. “In fact, give him 10 and a bit.”

The lad with the blond mop and the freckles – Briñas’s words – was the best among 40 kids who were invited back for a second trial at the Madrid football federation’s Cotorruelo pitches on the Vía Lusitana nearby and joined Atlético soon after, aged 11. “I wanted to play for the first team, maybe even to score a goal for them,” Torres said this weekend. The shirt he had just handed Briñas was the one he had been wearing when he scored his 100th.

It has taken a while. Nearly 15 years have passed between the two goals. Torres’s first came against Albacete in June 2001, when he was 17, just a kid, and Atlético Madrid were down in the Second Division for the first time since 1934, living perhaps the worst moment in their history. His latest comes as he approaches his 32nd birthday, when he’s just called The Kid and Atlético are probably living their best moment. When he scored his first, Jean-Francois Hernández was among his team-mates; when he scored his 100th, Jean-Francois’s son Lucas was.

Trailing 1-0, Atlético had turned the game around with two headers from corners – the first of them from such close range that it wasn’t just the ball that ended up in the net, goalscorer José María Giménez did too – before Torres’s moment arrived in the 90th minute. He stretched to nudge in Luciano Vietto’s cross, sealing Atlético’s first win in four and Diego Simeone’s 100th victory since joining the club – a total the Argentinian coach has reached quicker than anyone in La Liga history except Miguel Muñoz and Pep Guardiola.

But this was not about the win, or not only; that was not why the Calderón erupted or why, over on the bench, so did Simeone, looking to the sky waving his arms like a prayer had been answered, some religious revelation. “It was emotional,” Simeone said. “I want say an enormous congratulations to him.”

Behind him, the kit man Dimcho was scrabbling around, looking for something. He passed it to Simeone, who gave it to Yannick Carrasco, who called to Giménez, who ran over to get it then ran back and gave it to Torres. An Atlético shirt with “100” on the back. Torres unfolded it and showed it to the supporters, who stood to applaud. Then he threw it towards fans at the south end of the ground … and missed. A security guard collected it from the space in front of the stand and chucked it back in.

The shirt had been made some time ago. It has taken a while, alright. Torres had been stuck on 99 goals for 20 matches; his 99th had come against Eibar and now so too had his 100th – an entire round of games later. Atlético had faced every team in the league without Torres adding to the tally. There was joy on Saturday but there was relief too. As if justice had finally been done, as if he had been liberated. As if they all had. They were delighted he could celebrate his 100th goal and even more delighted at the way he did, so like Torres: one of them, aware of where he is and where he came from.

It is hard to do justice to just how much of an idol Torres is at the Calderón, where Liverpool shirts were worn after his departure and the goal that won Spain’s first international tournament in 44 years was considered theirs, not least because he celebrated it, and the World Cup, by draping himself in an Atlético flag. They love The Kid who always supported them and who, the way they see it, dragged them out of the Second Division, who left to conquer the world but never forgot them and fulfilled his promise to return. But it had started to feel like he really could be stuck on 99 forever, like some eternally frustrated batsman. The possibility was too cruel to contemplate, but it was real.

Atlético’s transfer ban and this winter’s window had drawn attention to the unexpected precariousness of his future at the Calderón. Torres is owned by Milan, officially on loan at Atlético. His contract is up at the end of the season, at which point the assumption was that he, then a free agent, would join Atlético for the rest of his career – albeit on a much reduced salary. But the ban, if it is confirmed before the summer window opens, would make that impossible. The only way of being sure that Torres would continue was to sign him from Milan during this window and they didn’t.

Even if they can sign in the summer, it was no longer clear that they wanted Torres to stay. After all, while Simeone had talked about the importance of a sense of “belonging”, and embraced Torres, he admitted that his future at the club would depend on his performances. And that’s where the doubts lay.

Torres returned to Atlético seven and a half years on, a hero gratefully heading home and determined to repay them. He’d never beaten rivals Real before and then, on his “re-debut” in the cup, he did; eight days later, he scored at the Bernabéu for the first time. For the second, too. He even scored 38 seconds into the next round against Barcelona and contributed an assist in that 4-0 win over Real. But in the end, he scored just three league goals last season and Saturday’s strike was just his third this season.

Against Eibar, he had come on as a substitute. He has only started seven times in the league and his last start was last year. Injury has not helped, of course, but it was not just that. Simeone no longer seemed to see a place for him. When you are a striker your difficulties are quantifiable, there is no hiding place, however much fans admire you – and for many Atlético supporters Torres is the most important player in their history. And although he said all the right things, as he always does, it felt like the end might be drawing near.

During this winter window, there were suggestions that Torres could leave now, but the man who did go was Jackson Martínez. A photo shows nine men in a room: eight of them are grinning, the one who isn’t is the one who actually has to go and play football in China. Jackson had accepted that move; Torres would not. His agent talked of an offer that would make him among the best paid players in the world but he did not want to leave: a World Cup, European Championship, European Cup and Uefa Cup winner, he was desperate to win something with his club, to give himself this last chance, even if in the summer he did have to go. Besides, how could he go on 99?

It is tempting to suggest that Torres’s 100th goal alone vindicates the decision to stay, that whatever else happens now Saturday’s moment will never be taken from him; that what no matter what the shirt he gave to Briñas and that Briñas decided to share with everyone will always hang in the club’s museum. But it is as natural as it is necessary to look beyond that too. It could be that there remains a risk that his 100th is his last, the end not just a staging post, yet it is also tempting to see the 100th as a liberation, to see things differently now, to grasp at the hope of more. No least because things are not as they were a week ago.

“Jackson’s failure is my fault,” Simeone said when he left. His fault, Torres’s opportunity? When it came to the numbers Torres was not contributing any less than the other strikers, Antoine Griezmann apart. Griezmann has 12 in the league, Jackson left with two, Correa has two, Carrasco has three and Vietto has one. Torres now has three. More to the point, he now has 100, the anxiety and the need met at last; “I’m delighted the goal has returned,” Simeone said. He needed this too. Jackson left last week. Torres returned to fitness the same week. On Thursday night he recovered an old superstition: he went out for a burger. Two days later he scored, 20 matches since his last goal, 15 years since his first goal, and 21 years since Manuel Briñas laid eyes on the 10-year-old with the blond mop and the freckles.

80-81
Real Zaragoza made the early running but fell away, before Atlético Madrid took control, remaining top for 25 weeks. In truth, it was a strange and compelling season, with everybody seemingly capable of beating each other. However it was Atlético’s spectacular capitulation that left the door open. After beating Barcelona in week 27, Atléti failed to win any of their final seven fixtures, leaving the door open for their cross-city rivals and Real Sociedad. Both Real Madrid & Erreala finished the season with a surge, and with one match to play, it was Real Sociedad who led Los Merengues by a point.
===  ===
2016-02-06 Torres finally got his 100th goal for Atletico in injury time against Eibar, the 99th coming 4 months earlier against the same team. In the process, Simeone recorded his 100th league win as Atleti manager.

==== Founding of Atlético de Madrid in 1903 ====
Club Atlético de Madrid was founded on 26 April 1903, but not under that name. Basque students decided to found a new club in Madrid, as a branch of Athletic de Bilbao from the Basque Country in Spain. The students named their team Athletic Club de Madrid. Just like the original club, Athletic de Madrid played in blue and white. Four years later, on 20 February 1907, Athletic de Madrid became a financially independent club.
When a representative of Athletic de Bilbao couldn’t find Blackburn’s blue and white striped shirts on a trip to England in 1911, he decided to bring shirts of Southampton back home. Athletic de Bilbao decided to fully switch to Southampton’s colours, while the Madrileans stuck with their blue shorts. On 22 January 1911, Athletic de Madrid play the first match in their famous colours: red and white striped shirts and blue shorts.
First Atlético shirt
First Atlético shirt
At the time, colchónes (mattresses) in Spain were made with red-white stripes. With their new colours, Atlético soon earned the nickname los Colchoneros (the Mattressmakers).
In 1913, Athletic de Madrid contested the final for the regional Championship against Madrid Foot-Ball (later renamed as Real Madrid). If Athletic de Madrid won, they would have qualified for the Copa del Rey, however Spanish rules disallowed two connected clubs from participating in the same competition, and Athletic de Bilbao had already qualified.
Los Colchoneros went on to lose the regional Championship, but decided to cut ties with their Basque counterparts anyway, and Athletic de Madrid became a fully independent football club.
==== Period before the Civil War ====

Athletic de Madrid celebrated their first success when the regional Championship was finally captured in 1921, qualifying for the Copa del Rey.Real Unión de Irún is beaten, but Athletic de Bilbao prove to be too strong in the final. The club from which Athletic de Madrid originated wins 4-1 in a very friendly game and lift the King’s Cup.
Two years later Atlético moves to its own stadium: Estadio Metropolitano.
In 1925 Athletic de Madrid win the regional Championship for the second time, without losing a game. The team qualifies for the semi final of the Copa del Rey, but lose to FC Barcelona.
A year later Athletic de Madrid finish second in the regional Championship, and changes to the format means the club does qualify for the Copa del Rey. The team reaches to the final for the second time in the history of the club, but lose to Barcelona again, this time in controversial fashion.
At the end of the decade, Athletic de Madrid, like many other football clubs, were having financial difficulties. To gain more income the Spanish clubs decide to found a domestic system, consisting of three leagues. Athletic de Madrid plays in the Primera División, along big clubs like FC Barcelona, Athletic de Bilbao and Real Madrid. Meanwhile the regional championship is also still played, which Athletic de Madrid win for the third time in 1928. In the second season of the Primera División, Athletic de Madrid are relegated on the last day of the season.
In the seasons after the team would often finish second, but never gain promotion. This changed when the Primera División is expanded by two teams and Athletic de Madrid, which again finish second, gain promotion because of the expansion. Athletic battled against relegation in the next few seasons, until the league is stopped for four years because of the Spanish Civil War.
==== Period after the Civil War ====

When the Primera División resumed after the Civil War, Athletic de Madrid had lost eight players due to the war. The club decided to merge with Aviación Nacional, and was named Atlético Aviación de Madrid.
Under charge of the legendary former-goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora, Atlético Aviación win the Primera División in 1939/1940. And at the start of the next season, the club also wins the Spanish Supercup. Atlético Aviación dominated the league and were again crowned champions.
In 1947, the Spanish air forces requested that Atlético Aviación remove the military association in the club’s name (Aviación is the name of the airforce). The club is renamed and becomes Club Atlético de Madrid.
On the last day of the season Atlético de Madrid lose the title to Valencia because of a home loss against Real Madrid. Atlético continues to be a challenger in the  following seasons, but can’t beat Valencia, Barcelona and Real Madrid.
In 1949 Atlético plays two friendlies against Stade Rennes, which is coached by Helenio Herrera. A year later Atlético signs the coach, who joins two of his former players in goalkeeper Domingo and forward Ben Barek, who had impressed in the double encounter.
In Herrera’s first season, Atlético wins the title, after some spectacular matches, including a 6-6 draw against Athletic Bilbao. In the last game of the season Atlético plays against Valencia. The final result is 4-4, which sees Atlético finish first in the league, just one point ahead of Deportivo la Coruña.
The following season was one to remember, and the players from that year have gone down in club history as the Golden Team. Herrera plays a 3-2-5 formation and Atlético again win the Primera División.
Atlético were flying high. Rule changes had an affect though, and the club were no longer allowed to play foreigners in the side. The next season the team won the Spanish Super Cup, but important players are forced to leave. Atlético slumped and woulld have to wait a long time for the next piece of silverware.
==== European debut ====

Ten years later and Atlético are improving. In the 1957/58 season, Atléti finished second behind Real Madrid in the league and reveal plans for a new stadium. Because Real Madrid had won both the league and the European Cup, Atlético qualify for European football as the runner-up in Spain.
In the semi final of the European Cup, Atlético face Real Madrid after beating Irish, Bulgarian and German opposition. After two matches the tie was drawn, and after a playoff match, Real Madrid advances.
Atlético were to get revenge on their city rivals over the next few years. In the following season, 1959/60, Atlético won the Copa del Rey for the first time in their history. A year later they add a second. Both times the mighty Real Madrid is beaten in the final.
The domination of a Real side with Puskas and Di Stefano continues, with Atlético also lifting the Spanish Super Cup at the expense of los Merengues.
Atlético can’t quite usurp Real Madrid yet in the league though, and once again finish runner-up in the Primera División, qualifying for the European Cup Winners’ Cup.
Los Colchoneros made it all the way to the final of the competition and in May 1962 face Fiorentina in the final. The match was tight and ended 1-1 after extra time. A replay match was scheduled in Stuttgart, and Atlético take home their first European title with a thumping 3-0 win.
Dominance in the Cup Winners’ Cup looked on the cards and Atléti made it through to the final for the second season running, but English opposition Tottenham Hotspur are too strong, and Atlético slump to a 5-1 defeat.
Vicente Calderón

Despite the success in Europe, Atlético found themselves in trouble. A financial crisis forces Atlético to sell the Estadio Metropolitano.
In 1964 Vicente Calderón is appointed as new club president. He brings in new players, like Luis Aragonés, and Atlético reach the final of the Copa del Rey. A year later Atlético reach the semi-final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but are knocked out by Italian giants Juventus.
The Copa del Rey is claimed again after an impressive run to the final against Real Madrid, Valencia, Real Sociedad and Zaragoza.
Atlético waved goodbye to the Estadio Metropolitano in 1966, celebrating another league title, finishing a single point ahead of Real Madrid.
The following season, Luis Aragonés scores the first ever goal in the new stadium, Estadio Manzanares.
Glory years

After appointing former-goalkeeper Marcel Domingo as new first team coach, Atlético continues winning and captures the league title with some impressive displays. A season later the title is lost on the last day of the season against Valencia.
That year Atlético expands its stadium and renames it after one of the most successful presidents in history, Vicente Calderón.
Atlético is knocked out early in the European Cup in 1972/73, which allows the team to focus on the league. With an impressive run of games, the team wins the title, two points ahead of Barcelona.
A season later Atlético appoints a coach from Argentina: Lorenzo. The club signs many South Americans and earns the nickname Los Indios, because the tanned South-Americans remind the Spanish people of Indians. Lorenzo’s defensive tactics prove successful, because Atlético reach the final of the European Cup.
Atlético’s first proper European Cup final is a dramatic affair. 1-0 up going into the dying seconds, Bayern defender Georg Schwarzenbeck thumps the ball from 25 yards into the back of the net past Atléti goalkeeper Miguel Reina. Heartbreak. In the replay two days later, Bayern take advantage of a tired Atlético side and win 4-0.
Bayern refuse to play against a tough Independiente side in the Intercontinental Cup, so Atlético gets the chance to win the competition now known as the Club World Championship, and so Atléti does. It’s the first success of Luis Aragonés as coach.
A year later Aragonés’ men win the Copa del Rey, a title which was controversially lost to Real Madrid the season before. In 1976/77 Atlético win the Primera División for the eighth time after a thrilling title race with Cruyff’s Barcelona.
==== Dry years ====
It would be the last title Atlético would to celebrate for a while. The performances went downhill and 1978/79 would be a disastrous year. After just five matches coach Núñez is fired and Luis Aragonés temporarily returns to coach the team, but was later replaced by Hungarian Szusza.
Atlético as a club are moving downhill, and during the season the players go on a strike, hoping to force circumstances to be improved. As a result the club controversially suspends player Ayala.
It would be a long time before Atlético got to celebrate success again. In 1984/85 the team wins the Copa del Rey in Aragonés’ third spell as first team coach (he has a total of seven!).
At the start of the next season Atlético also wins the Spanish Super Cup. And in the same season Aragonés would lead the team to the final of the European Cup Winners Cup, but Dinamo Kiev are too strong, and Atlético fall to a 3-0 defeat.
==== Gil y Gil Years ====
The following period is one of much turmoil, with Jesús Gil y Gil taking over the club in 1987. The fans were desperate for a new la Liga title and Gil gained power by promising to sign Paulo Futre.
This lead to success in the Copa del Rey – Atlético won the cup in 1990/91 and 1991/92 – but in the meantime Atlético became a graveyard of coaches.
The controversial club president closes Atlético’s cantera in 1992 and slowly seems to lead the club toward bankrupcy, signing expensive players the club cannot afford.
However, Gil’s actions did lead to success in 1995/96. After nearly twenty years, Atlético finally win the Spanish league again, and also win the Copa del Rey to make it a fantastic double. Even today, every fan remembers the famous Doblete, with players like Caminero, Simeone, Pantic and Kiko, all lead by coach Radomir Antic.
In the following seasons Atlético would sign big players like Christian Vieri, Juninho and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, but eventually Gil’s reign lead to Atlético’s demise.
In 1999/2000 Gil and his board were suspended pending investigation by the Spanish government regarding financial issues. It was one of the many lawsuits against Jesús Gil y Gil, but surely one with huge consequences for Atlético.
With the club in turmoil, the performances on the pitch dropped to an abysmal level. Despite reaching the final of the Copa del Rey, Atlético were relegated on the final match of the season, after Pichichi-winner Hasselbaink failed to convert a penalty against Real Oviedo. Then manager Claudio Ranieri resigned as Atlético were heading for the Segunda.
Atlético spent two seasons in Spain’s second division, which were described as dos años en el infierno – two years in hell.
==== A new hope ====
In the first season in the Segunda División, a young Fernando Torres made his debut for Atlético. The club narrowly missed out on promotion, but a new star was born. In 2001/02 Torres led Atleti back to la Liga, under charge of who else than Luis Aragonés.
For years the club finished in mid-table positions, before the icon for many fans Fernando Torres was eventually sold to Liverpool. With the money gained from the transfer, Atlético was able to reinforce the team with star players like Diego Forlán, Luis García, Simão and Reyes, which led to Champions League qualification in 2007/2008. Javier Aguirre, as Atlético manager, was improving the squad all the time and it seemed only a matter of time before more silverware was won.
Forlán formed an illustrous pairing with Sergio Agüero, who was signed the year before Torres’ departure. The young Argentina grew up to become a superstar, while his Uruguayan compatriot took care of the goalscoring.
In 2008/2009 Atlético again qualified for the Champions League, with Diego Forlán winning the Pichichi-award as topscorer of the Spanish league. The team seemed to have built a solid foundation for next season, but at the start of 2009/10 everything seemed to go wrong. Javier Aguirre, deemed to be the root of Atlético’s misery, was controversially sacked, and replaced by legendary goalkeeper Abel Resino.
Resino didn’t last until the end of the year. Following a heavy 4-0 defeat to English club Chelsea in the Champions League, the manager was sacked and replaced with Quique Sánchez Flores. At this time, Atleti had just crashed out of the Champions League and were second from bottom in the league.
It took a while before Sánchez Flores was able to turn things around, and while the performances in the league were inconsistent, the team were magnificent in the cup competitions, going all the way in the Europa League and Spanish Cup.
On 12 May 2010 Atlético played the final of the Europa League, which was reached after beating Galatasaray, Sporting Lisbon, Valencia and Liverpool. The final was against English club Fulham, which Atleti won in extra time (2-1), with two goals from Diego Forlán.
A week later Atlético played the final of the Copa del Rey at the Camp Nou versus Sevilla. This final was lost, but for the first time since El Doblete the fans had had something to dream about, and celebrated the Europa League win, like always, at Fuente de Neptuno.

behind them while absorbing a war ethic in which military values transcended the level of mere personal valor and were placed in the service of the Francoist state.
====   ====
Athletic Bilbao was ordered to drop its traditional English title and stick to the Spanish Atletico. The regime resurrected the phrase Furia Espanola (Spanish Fury) as its favorite sporting mantra. Franco held up Basque soccer players as examples of how the game should be
played, while stripping the Basque nation, along with Catalonia, of its rights and freedoms. Franco dusted off the image of the ideal
Spaniard and of traditional Spain and transferred it to the soccer stadium, there to share company with Don Quixote, in the spirit of non-
compromise. No matter that in time such inflexibility might tilt
against Quixote's self-interest and against reality. His hopelessness and failure could be forgotten beside the nobility of purpose. Thus,
the quintessential virtues of the Spanish soccer player were destined to be bravery, honor, and pride in his endeavor to conquer the enemy.
The myth of a deluded Castilian knight had been walking across much of Spanish history, leaving behind a trail of stereotypes and
conditioning an entire aesthetic of the Spaniard. But it was given fresh stimulus by the Spanish right-wing militarism fueled by the
Spanish Civil War.


====   ====
￼It was in the town of Salamanca, turned by Franco from one of 
Spain's great centers of academic learning into his military head
quarters, that a new hybrid soccer emerged from the trenches. It was there in 1937 that a young noncommissioned officer called Francisco Gonzalez picked the best soccer players among his soldiers and,
during their periods of rest from military duties, trained them as a team called Aviacion Nacional, or National Air Force. It competed in
an embryonic Copa del Generalissimo with teams from other towns
occupied by Franco forces such as Zaragoza and Real Sociedad of San Sebastian.
====   ====
￼Aviacion played in blue shorts and trousers^ the same colors as the
Spanish Falange. Tt included German, Vazquez, and Campos—young recruits from the Canaries who had learned the ball skills associated
with Latin Americans—and some veterans of the old Atlelico de Madrid team such as Mesa, Gomez, and Machin, who played a more
aggressive game, with some flair. A coherent style of play was not a
priority. What mattered was the spirit,
The old Atletico had been relegated to the Second Division prior
to the military uprising and was encumbered with a debt estimated at y million pesetas. Eight of Atletico's players were killed while fighting in the subsequent Civil War. Once the conflict was over, Atletico was forced into a merger with the nascent Aviacion. The new club, called Club Athletic de Aviacion, was officially launched in October 1939. It was initially deeply unpopular with Atleticos traditional tans. Atletico had originally been founded by three Basques and grown up in the
working-class outskirts of the capital, near the river Manzanares, The
appearance of Aviacion came to symbolize the control that the emerging Franco regime wished to exert over soccer. The merger was forced
through by the newly appointed high command of the Spanish Soccer Federation as a precondition for Aviacion's registration as a First
Division club.
====   ====
￼The merged club agreed to play in Atletico's colors—red and white
stripes and blue shorts—as a token concession to tradition. But its senior management was composed of military men and civilian officials
who had fought for Franco. They had firm views about soccer's polit ical usefulness and how the game should be played by Spaniards, In 1947 the club reverted to the old name of Atletico de Madrid and in
subsequent years developed a reputation as the capital's "badlands," less establishment than Real Madrid and less rich,
Tn Una historia de una fabula (A book of fables), Spanish journalist and Atletico fan Carlos Morino Benito imagines the impact the
====   ====
￼hard-line and dogmatic Francoist mentality has had on the ethos of a club that had always taken pride in its creativity and unpredictability. In one episode, loosely based on oral history passed down
through generations of tans, an unnamed Francoist officer barks instructions at Ricardo Zamora, the legendary goalkeeper who was appointed the new clubs coach in its First full postwar season 1939-1940. "I'm telling you no, Ricardo, I don't want to hear your
excuses or justifications—your team is not playing well, and you know it. What's lacking in this team, Richard, is cojones, a lot of cojones. . . . [T]he team has to run more and throw everything at the
opposition. Zamora, stop trying to please so much. . . . [A] coach needs to have a bit of spunk, impose discipline, use the whip now
and again," shouts the officer.
====   ====
￼This was soccer played as if it were another battle of the Civil War, blood and cojones, and fury, with no room or time for discussion, de
bate, let alone finessing technique and individual skill as part of a harmonious whole. It says something nevertheless for the quality of some
of the players and the personality of Zamora himself that Atletico Aviacion went on to win the first two seasons of the postwar Spanish
league. Then Zamora was unceremoniously tired alter several military officers linked to the club complained, falsely, that he had not been as
loyal to the Franco forces as he should have been during the Civil War.
But such was El Divino's popular standing that Zamora soon returned to the fold of Spanish soccer as coach of the national team. It proved
the biggest challenge of his career/
Spain had not played in the 1938 World Cup, immersed as it was in its Civil War, but the Franco regime was anxious to see the national
squad make up for lost time and gain a veneer of diplomatic acceptance. So while the outbreak of World War II effectively disrupted international soccer and the cooperation of FIFA member states, Spain's soccer authorities organized a series of friendly matches. With the ex-

￼At the club level, Atletico Aviacion regained some national honor when it heat a visiting side from the Italian air force in Christmas
1942,6-2.The game was played in the Metropolitano stadium, which had been rebuilt after suffering major damage during the Civil War. Its
design and construction under military management were held up as
examples of Franco's urban regeneration, rising, like Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium, from the ruins of war.
====   ====
￼In the following weeks local soccer fans, encouraged by the extensive
coverage provided by the Spanish soccer media, marveled at the play of the Argentine visitors. What they saw was the best of the attacking soccer made famous by La Maquina and now made part of an intricate display of quick short passes and turns, skillful flicks and lobs, and magical
goals.The team came to be known as El Ciclon (The Cyclone) because
of the speed and artistry with which it mesmerized and ran circles
around most opponents. "What occurred between the 21st December and the end of January 1947 seemed unreal and inexpressible," commented the Spanish newspaper El Pais in a tribute published on the fiftieth anniversary of the tour. "The daily press and the magazines doubled their normal soccer coverage. San Lorenzo, despite playing in the
cold, snow, and intense rainfall of that winter, caused a sensation."

====   ====
￼In their first game in Madrid's Metropolitano stadium, with most of their players still recovering from an exhausting transatlantic flight, San Lorenzo beat host Atletico Aviacion 4-1/lWo days later the Argentine club played in the same stadium and lost by the same margin to Real Madrid. On the eve of the game, San Lorenzo's captain, the
Basque Zubieta, was overheard telling a friend that he hoped his team would double their scorecard against the winners that season of the
Copa del Generalissimo. "Beating Real Madrid will be the real marker for the whole tour because they are well known in Argentina and are
today Spanish champions," Zubieta said. The boast prompted the Madrid captain, Ipina, another Basque, to rally his players. At a meet
ing on the eve of the game he told them, "I am prepared to bust a gut tomorrow, and T expect the same from all of vou. What on no account must we do is fight with the same arms as them." Ipiha proposed quite simply that the team focus on closing down San Lorenzo's game and beating them on the counterattack. The strategy would include
====   ====
￼Villalonga took Atletico de Madrid to two successive victories over Real Madrid in the Copa del Generalissimo in 1961 and 1962 and
over Fiorentino in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup in
1962, so that it entered the history books as the first Spanish club to win a European championship with an unbeaten record during the
tournament. These were glory days for Atletico — los colchoneros the mattress men named because the old-style Spanish mattresses were
covered in red and white stripes like the club colors. These were as
good a times for the Spanish league's most erratic performers as that earlier period of success when—under Helenio Herrera — the club
won the league championship in 1950 and 1951. Two players from
Villalonga's period—Joaquin Peiro and Enrique Collar—came to be dubbed the "Infernal Wing" (Ala infernal) because of the combined
work ethos, speed, and skill they demonstrated down the left flank.

Villalonga's appointment as national coach was not without criticism. Diehard Real Madrid fans regarded him as a bit of a traitor for
moving to Atletico. The Spanish soccer world generally saw him for what he was—a soldier turned PE teacher with limited technical
knowledge of the game whose successes were due more to the individual talent of his players than to inspiration he might have given
them. Yet political considerations appear to have prevailed, and Villaonga was given the opportunity to prove that he was not as bad as some people made him out to be.
===  ===

====   ====
Formed as Athletic Club de Madrid by three Basques studying in the city, Gortazar, Aztorcha and Abdon, the team began as a sort of social club for homesick Athletic Bilbao fans resident in the city. It is Atletico's roots in the Basque Country which have ensured that they would always play second fiddle to Real, at least in terms of patronage and image. A group of young things met in the cafe La Maison Doree in Alcala street, where they decided to extend the influence of their home team by writing up the club's founding statutes in 1903 in exactly the same terms as those of Athletic Bilbao. 

Bilbao had been in official existence for five years and the three men initially saw the creation of the club as a branch of the original one - perhaps thinking that they could literally start up another 'Athletic'. It was only when they were joined the following year by dissident members of Madrid FC that the club truly got off the ground. They wore blue and white stripes, as did Bilbao, but in 1911 changed to the famous red and white. This time it was Bilbao who followed them, in 1914, indicating that by then the Madrid branch was assuming a separate identity. It is sadly ironic that by the turn of the same century several of the club's followers would be in the dock for the murder of a Basque supporter. The roots were clear, right down to the name.￼
====   ====
Atletico Madrid are one of the most complex and paradoxical of Spain's clubs. They stand in third place in the all-time Spanish league, with nine league titles and nine cups to their name, not to mention a European Cup final appearance (1974) and a Cup-Winners Cup win (1962). Nevertheless, they always seem somehow marginahsed, kept at arm's length from the mainstream, out on the polluted banks of the Manzanares river, by the gas works. Their supporters, along with those of Sporting Gijon, are the most feared in Spain, and the Vicente Calderon was never a friendly place for visitors, even before the notorious stabbing incident. The two so-called Ultra groups, Frenie AtUtico and Bastion, fought among themselves for supremacy until the latter, a particularly xenophobic group, were disbanded after the court case. Both groups, however, regarded Madrid's Ultras Sur as a gang of sissies, beneath contempt - an attitude well documented by the journalist Antonio Salas whose excellent book Diario de un Skin (Diary of a Skinhead) narrates the tale of his infiltration into the murky and often surreal underworld of Madrid's neo-Nazi fraternity. 

There's something slightly scrufly and unprepossessing about Atletico. Like 1970s Millwall, they prefer you to hate them. In fact they thrive on it. Gil, the former mayor of Marbella and president of his own ￼
====   ====
eponymous political party GIL (laughably standing for 'Independent Liberals'), exploited this 'bad boys on the outskirts of town* image for all it was worth. He claimed constantly that the world was against the club, that every game lost represented a political conspiracy against his party, planned by the referees' association in cahoots with the football feder ation, all of whose pinko members belonged to the Socialist PSOE, his natural enemies and rivals in Marbella. Before Gil was stripped of the title of mayor, his team ran out with 'Marbella' emblazoned across their shirts, a curious sight, but not the first time that the club had suffered from an identity crisis. They were not even called Atletico until 1947, having previously been known as Athletic Club de Madrid and Atletico Aviadon. Having reached two King's Cup finals (both lost) in the Twenties, they were in on the first league competition in 1929, but finished bottom the next season. They returned briefly in 1934, only to be relegated the next season, under the management of the ubiquitous Samitier. The Civil War saved their bacon, for when the league resumed in 1939 they were chosen to replace Oviedo, whose ground had been totally destroyed in the conflict. ￼But 'they' were now called Atletico Aviaci6n. Since eight of Athletic's 
====   ====
best players had died in the war, the board of directors persuaded one Colonel Francisco Salamanca to merge his crack airforce team with what was left of Athletic Club and rename them Athletic Aviacion - changed several months later by Franco's decree to Atletico Aviacion, no team being allowed to sport a foreign name. Many of the players were from the Canary Islands, though this fails to explain why they were so good. The club was now Spanish in name and the incorporation of the Aviacion players had finally put paid to any connection with the old Basque roots. They certainly got off to a flyer. For a team that were supposed to have been playing in the Second Division, the upper tier held few fears for them and they won it in that first season after the war, 1939-40. Not content with that achievement, they did it again the next season, finishing five places and nine points above their more famous rivals over at Chamartin. For both titles they were managed by no less a figure than Ricardo Zamora, his first years in management proving as fruitful as his early years as a goalkeeper. He went on to manage Spain, if only for seven days, in 1952. After the Second World War the club decided to drop the military association in its name and finally settled for the current name of Atletico Madrid in 1947. This was the year in which they thrashed Real 
====   ====
Madrid 5-0 in the Metropolitano, to date their biggest win over their rivals - in the only season when the latter have come close to relegation. Atletico took the title again in 1950 and 1951 under Helenio Herrera, having taken on one of the first black players to appear in the Spanish league, the skilful Moroccan Ben Barek. 

As soon as Herrera had gone, Di Stefano's Real Madrid took over and Atletico went into something of a decline, although they were always there or thereabouts, struggling up through the pomp and noise surrounding Real and Barcelona to make a valid claim for themselves as Spain's 'third team'. Bilbao might dispute this, but between 1951 and 1966, as white a period as you can get, Atletico were four times runners- up, three times losing cup finalists and three times cup winners. There were even three years in which the morbo focus shifted from Barcelona and moved over exclusively to the capital. In 1959, both Madrid sides reached the semi-finals of the European Cup and were drawn together. Atletico came close to breaking up that famous run of trophy wins, winning 1-0 in the Metropolitano after Real had taken the first leg 2-1 at the Bernabeu. In the replay in Zaragoza, Real won 2-1. In 1960, the cup final in Chamartin was another fiesta of madridismo, the first time the two clubs from the capital had met in the final - both having won 8-0 in their semi-finals. Puskas opened the scoring for Real, but when Gento was taken out by Isacio Calleja and forced to spend the rest of the game hobbling, Atletico took over and healed some of the scars of the previous year, to the tune of 3-1. Next season they were back, Atletico this time winning 3-2, despite the inevitable goals from Puskas and Di Stefano. ￼
====   ====
Just to keep the run going, Atletico finally won themselves a European trophy in 1962, knocking out Leicester City on the way to the Cup- Winners Cup final, where they beat Fiorentina 3-0 in a replay in Stuttgart, four months after the original game at Hampden Park. Unfortunately, three of Atletico's best years had coincided with their neighbours' glorious prime, which goes some way to explaining why they began to develop a chip on their shoulder. Rivalry certainly existed between the two clubs, but it was never as explicit as that which simmered between Madrid and Catalonia. It was as if Real Madrid preferred not to get too deeply involved in any extra morbo with their poorer neighbours, partly out of wanting to save it all for Bar^a and partly out of indifference. By ignoring Atletico, Real implied there was no competition. Atletico fell for it, and began to take on a rougher edge to compensate for the snub. ￼
====   ====
By 1974, when they reached their only European Cup final, they were managed by the Argentine Juan Carlos Lorenzo, whose Estudiantes side of the late Sixties had not exactly been assiduous followers of the Corinthian way. Against Celtic in the semi-final in Glasgow, the Turkish referee sent off three Atletico players, but they still managed a 0-0 draw. In the final in Brussels against the Bayern Munich of Sepp Maier, Paul Breitner, Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Muller, Luis Aragones opened the scoring in extra time, only for the defender Georg Schwarzenbeck to equalise with an astonishing 25-yarder, 30 seconds from the end. In the replay, Bayern walked it 4-0, and the dream dissolved before Atletico's eyes. They made the quarter-finals again as recently as 1997, after their double year, but Ajax put them out in a close-run thing. Even then, the side were far from popular in Spain, their double having been won, according to most observers, by kicking opponents into submission. With Diego Simeone snarling in midfield and centre-back Juan Manuel Lopez earning himself 44 yellow cards in his first 65 games for the club, the evidence seems to back up the accusations. Gil was having none of it of course, making an emotional speech then falling drunk into the Neptune fountain in Madrid.

What the new century holds for Atletico and Real Madrid will undoubtedly depend on financial (and legal) factors that were not in the frame back at the beginning of the previous one. As in the case of Barcelona, Spanish history was made here - through death, dictatorship, financial scandals and football. In the next 100 years they will more likely be looking for a little less turbulence and a lot more triumph.
We shall see.

Luckily Atletico were playing in raining Galicia against Celta Vigo. 4 second half goals, 3 from crosses earned them their first win of the season.
===  ===
Simeone first signed for Atlético Madrid as a player in 1994. In doing so, he entered the world of ‘the other’. Los Colchoneros had, and still have, a long and proud history of being underdogs. Locally they stand a clear second to Real Madrid, whose indifference of the city rivalry only fuels frustrations on the Atlético side. Domestically, Atlético have also tended to lag behind Barcelona, who along with Real Madrid have won 56 of 85 Spanish league titles.

If Real are the Galácticos and Barcelona are a cultural symbol of regional pride, Atlético’s identity has always appeared much quainter by comparison. This is something the club has fed on from time to time, however, using it to generate a fervent atmosphere at their Vicente Calderón home ground, a place few teams have historically enjoyed visiting. During their periods of greatest achievement, Atlético have thrived on their otherness.

Simeone’s first year in Madrid was a confusing one. No fewer than four coaches graced the Atlético dugout in 1994-95, but Raddy Antić’s arrival in July 1995 brought about greater stability. The Serb introduced precise, purposeful football and the club won a league and cup double in his first term at the helm. Simeone, still only 24 years of age, matured tactically under Antić, played an instrumental part. Seemingly indefatigable, his relentless runs from deep were core to Atlético’s attacking ambitions.

Antić’s preferred basic shape was a 4-4-2 in which the midfield became very narrow without possession, compressing space available for the opposition to exploit centrally. They pressed intelligently as a collective and, when the ball was won, instantly looked to get it forward through a high-tempo, short-passing game. Atlético’s second goal in a 3-1 home win over Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona that season perfectly distilled Antić’s tactics and Simeone’s role within them.

An aimless pass into Atlético’s half was collected by left-back Toni, who immediately played the ball inside to Simeone. Controlling and turning, Simeone then bypassed the pressure of two Barcelona players through a one-two with Juan Vizcaíno, before playing another one-two, this time with striker Kiko, who had dropped deep. This quick sequence of vertical passes created space for Simeone to drive into before playing the ball wider to José Luis Caminero on the right hand-side. With Barcelona having unsuccessfully attempted to set an offside trap, Caminero played a first time ball across the penalty area for Lyuboslav Penev to sweep into the net.


Eleven touches from six players was all it took to penetrate the opponent and score a crucial goal. And Simeone, with his dynamism and spirit, relished his more attacking role within the system; that season he finished second only to Penev in the Atlético scoring charts with 12 to his name.

Antić was unable to repeat the success of his first season. Atlético fell to fifth in 1996-97 and, after the club finished seventh the following year, he was dismissed and replaced by Arrigo Sacchi. By that point Simeone had already left for Inter, but Atlético’s history, tradition and underdog status had truly resonated with him as someone who fought and thought for everything he achieved as a player.

That success against the odds wouldn’t leave him and, when he returned to the club as head coach in 2011, he did so fully aware of the need for a counter-hegemonic mentality and style. Real Madrid and Barcelona were as dominant, if not more so than they had ever been, while Atlético had been in a state of constant flux. In the two years prior to Simeone’s appointment, the club had hired three different coaches. His predecessor Gregorio Manzano had been sacked on the back of a cup defeat to third-tier Albacete, while in the league Atlético were just four points off the relegation zone.

The circumstances were not dissimilar to those which preceded the club’s league and cup double in ’96, however. And, having learned his trade and experimented tactically in Argentina and Italy, Simeone set about implementing and refining what would come to be known as Cholismo.

“We want a team with commitment,” he stated upon taking the job. “One that plays, runs, trains, respects the rival, and understands the intelligence in the game.” The tactical pragmatism and unabated desire for work which had been instilled in Simeone from his youth would be laced through his Atlético side.

As the 1990-91 season began, Schuster was still without a club. Again, his favoured option was to remain in Spain and eventually he took up an offer from the larger-than-life Jesús Gil at Atlético Madrid. The move was typical Schuster, having been spurned by Real Madrid he popped up at their cross-city rivals. Questions were raised whether the teaming up of Gil and Schuster was some kind of publicity stunt, given both individuals’ temperamental personalities. With Atlético having struggled prior to Schuster’s arrival however, it became the catalyst for vast improvement.

With Schuster teaming up with Paulo Futre and Manolo to devastating effect, Atlético launched an unlikely title challenge. They also won back-to-back Copa del Rey’s in 1991 and 1992, the ‘92 success coming at the Bernabéu against Real Madrid. Schuster opened the scoring with a spectacular free-kick. The German played some of the best football of his career in the red and white stripes of Atleti. Playing again under Aragonés seemed to work wonders for Schuster.

His relationship with Gil inevitably soured in 1993. Injury problems kept him out of action for extended periods and Los Colchoneros didn’t function as well without Schuster’s presence. Gil resented Atléti dropping out of contention and he even accused Schuster of not doing enough to return to fitness. His time in Spain was coming to an end after thirteen remarkable years.

2016-08-27 First time Leganes had played Atletico Madrid since Atletico were in the second division. Leganes were in the top flight for the first time. The 2 draws against promoted teams was the first time Simeone had failed to win either of their first 2 league games at Atletico.

2016-08-21 The colour of nets have changed from red and white to white only. Yea due to new lpf rules. Pellegrino in charge of the Alaves playing their first game in the primera liga for 10 years, winning the 2nd division last season. Had a Torres, Raul Garcia and Kiko in their starting lineup (none of them related to the Atleti greats). Gameiro scored what was assumed to be the winner for a penalty in injury time for a foul that was not inside the area, and 121 seconds later Pellegrino's men snatched a point with a breathtaking shot from distance. It was one of Alaves' two shots on target to Atletico's 24.

By trying to control each successive technology the music industry only helps inspire people to devise new ways around it. are they ever going to get it? that brings us inevitably t dvds...to add insult to injury they added geographic area codes. ... it made a perverse sense to the industry.

Could the entertainment industry not hae predicted the obvious? ...yes while the industry was greedily trying to protect...through tehnology ...The DVD encryption was cracked not even by people who wanted to copy DVDs but by people who simply wanted to view them under linux. these are folks who actually wanted to buy dvds but they couldn't. the discs would have been useless on their equipment.

When investing in quality, it's not always the duration of the item, but the quality of experience or the amount of output it enbles you to produce.
e.g. a Macbook air might need to be replaced after 3 years just like any other computer (e.g. the battery runs down too quickly) but the pleasantness of the mouse and the cleanliness of the physical surface makes you much more willing to use it, so you get more work done (e.g. you reply to more emails so you foster more friendships, you do more web surfing so you learn more, you get more errands done)

Wanting Is Better Than Having

one's desire and anticipation for something is often better than the actual result. After all, desires and expectations are infinitely boundless, whereas the reality is limited by various flaws and limitations — which were overlooked during the daydreaming in expectation.

When he or she eventually gets the object of their desire, it seems it fails to live up to the unrealistic demands they've built up in their mind.

Best of both worlds?
Still others suggest the best solution is to strike a balance between saving and paying down debt that you -- and your family -- can live with.
Paula Langguth Ryan of Cocoa, Fla. -- author of personal finance books, such as the forthcoming "Break the Debt Cycle -- for Good!" -- is an advocate of this combination approach.

She says paying down debt in a steady, systematic way while also building up a little emergency savings helps reinforce sound spending and saving habits that continue to pay dividends long after the debt is gone.

"You're actually retraining your money habits," Ryan says.

Ryan concedes you may net more money by paying off the higher interest rate debt rather than putting money in savings. However, she says any short-term gain will be lost if you revert to using a credit card to cover emergencies.

"You just replace old debt with new debt," she says.

Creating an emergency fund is the only way to break the debt cycle, she says. Without such a cushion, chances are good that you will fall back into debt as soon as you're in a financial pinch -- no matter how much money you're throwing at your current debt.

phase gate fallacy
generalists don't start and finish one thing at a time. But they assume someone else will.
===  ===

If you can not work your way up the corporate ladder or make lots of money, then for most people the best way to quit the rat race is learn to be more efficient, buy less, fix things, live a simple "Green" life, use what money you make to pay off all debts.
If you can not make investments that make you X amount per year to live, then make a life style that uses Zero or very little money per year.

===  ===
For those starting out in their careers, being a generalist may also provide them with the opportunity to test their options before specialising. Dominic Wyld, head of graduate business at Guardian Jobs, says: "Having a range of different experiences and skill sets can allow employees to identify what their ideal role would be over time, and then look for specialist jobs. For example, the traditional graduate recruitment model at most large organisations would be for them to work in a number of different areas of the company before being identified as a specialist in one particlaur area."

At the opposite end of the career ladder, more generalist skills are also useful. Among the survey respondents, 60% thought their boss was a good generalist, and transferable skills – such as people management and leadership – are often associated with more senior roles.

Ripmeester says: "It's a given fact that the higher up the career ladder you go, the more general and managerial skills you need. If you are able to practise those and show that you excel at them early on, it could catapult your career to a different level."

Ultimately, supplementing your broad base of skills with a sprinkling of expert knowledge is your best bet. "This is a struggle for some personalities as some people like to deep dive into areas," says Pellowe.
 
If you are a specialist who wants to broaden your horizons and gain seniority, Pellowe suggests you "take on projects, join steering groups, do community and voluntary work to gain exposure".

Career
James Michener was a better writer than Ernest Hemingway because his books are longer. James Michener was a better writer than Ernest Hemingway because he could type 20 words-per-minute faster.

Assessing the effectiveness of writers based on productivity measures makes absolutely no sense.

Productivity measures are meant for tangible, consistently repeatable things, such as how many widgets a machine can manufacture in an hour or how many shirts a person can sew in a day (even the effectiveness in these situations can be challenged, but I’ll leave that for another day).

Productivity measures were never meant to measure the creation of new sources of value such as ideas and innovations. Measuring intangibles like original value is hard, while measuring concrete tangibles is easier, so naturally people gravitate to what is easiest, even when it’s wrong. Better to have some measure rather than nothing—right? As I’ve said before, give me a fuzzy metric of something valuable (an outcome) rather than a precise number for something unimportant (an output) any time.

Unfortunately, productivity mania has followed us into the creative digital age. Too many organizations are still obsessed with productivity measures, which limits their success when using agile delivery to drive business innovations. The new agile metric is velocity, but it’s just lines of code dressed up in new clothing. As many times as agile experts say “use velocity as a capacity indicator, not a productivity measure” velocity inevitably sets teams against teams and undermines both value and quality. Velocity is a quantity measure (output) and they get us in trouble every time.

Silbermann says, "Don't take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of advice to give--with a few exceptions--generalize whatever they did. Don't overanalyze everything. I myself have been guilty of overthinking problems. Just build things and find out if they work."

You don't have to do things exactly as others have done. Learn lessons from them, but don't feel bad for going your own way.

By contrast, in the US, you apply to the larger university and for the first year or more, you take courses from a variety of fields and only declare a major at the end of the first year or perhaps even during the second year. American universities have different “schools,” or departments, such as the School of Arts and Sciences, which houses a number of related majors. However, even after you declare a major at an American university, you are still expected to take classes outside of that field, known as “electives.” For this reason, we can say that the general emphasis of higher education in the US is breadth, or getting a range of knowledge from a variety of different subjects. In the UK, the emphasis is more on depth; getting a very thorough understanding of your chosen subject.

	Perhaps took on too much workload. I wanted to prove my credibility before giving instructions to others (I had leadership duties too)
	Needed junior contractor to do most of the leading and coordination and task-keeping
	Work hour expectations too much - I was in school part time
	Left because I would have continued to perform poorly (even though I passed probation)

Google			-	
	Did what was asked, but at times was struggling to find worthwhile work to do
	Told at one point that I need to produce more because I'm on a higher payscale than other contractors
	Left for better pay

Objectivity		-						
	Told I wasn't enough of a self starter (not given much detail) and didn't complete a high enough volume of work per week.
	Said I must keep an open line of communication with manager
	Ultimately failed probation and was fired
					


Other questions to start thinking about that we can discuss in the session.

What do I want?

	I want to identify the root cause that is consistently preventing me succeeding in my jobs. Possible reasons are:
	
		Focus
		Attention span
		Reading comprehension
		Listening comprehension
		Motivation

What am I tolerating?

	(I don't understand this question)

What is working for me?

	Nothing. But I know more than my peers in non-job-specific knowledge (technically - from books).

What will it take to keep me on track?

	Don't know

What am I willing/unwilling to change?

	Time spent working (my health won't permit longer hours)

What is present when I am at my best?

	Encouragement

What motivates me?

	Productivity enhancement
	Learning new things, gaining a deeper understanding of something

What am I resisting?

	Doing tasks without being told to work on them

If I were at my best, what would I do right now?

	Not sure

What are my assumptions?
Where do I limit myself?
Where do I hold back?
What are my expectations?
How can I have this be easy?

	Constructive feedback from manager (not "you didn't do this" but "next time you face that situation, do this")

What have I learned about myself?

	Nothing yet. That's my hope in having coaching sessions.

5-10 lines core


Dear hiring manager,

I am a strong core java developer. I have used java in 4 of my 5 jobs across products in several domains (ERP at Oracle, retail at Apple, finance at Google and systems at Objectivity). I have experience with multithreading to do asynchronous tasking, JNI to create language bindings for a database kernel, JConsole to identify bottlenecks, and collections. I also have experience developing and debugging database kernels written in C and C++ code.


5-10 rest

Dear Manager,

I have several years of experience doing rest development, both at work and recreationally. 

At Apple I created REST services for retail store employee applications to create technical support reservations via the web and mobile devices, as well as integration with Point of Sale applications. Some services were rewritten to use the Spring controller framework. 

Recreationally I have created rest services for my personal productivity web applications, one of which is backed by a Neo4j database. I have found JSON to be a powerful and flexible interchange format that can be easily processed both on the server and client. You can see the code for some of my Jersey-based REST services here:

https://github.com/sarnobat/yurl/blob/master/server.groovy
https://github.com/sarnobat/textsorter_web/blob/master/button_sorting/webserver_json.groovy

I am an advocate of the REST architecture for complex application systems since the HTTP protocol promotes loose coupling. Loose coupling gives components longevity. I appreciate the importance of longevity from a cost and productivity perspective. I also find jax-rs annotation-based rest services easy to understand.

I'm a good programmer from a good college. I know a lot about software development compared to my peers (e.g. I know what the law of demeter is). But I'm slow at completing a series of tasks. I think it's a mental stamina issue. I need time to switch from one task to another. I've failed repeatedly in jobs by not "stepping up". I don't know where to go to get better. Mentor? Psychologist? Career coach? Does anyone have any suggestions?

===  ===
Honestly most shops are looking for quick turn around. In fact a good friend of mine lost his last job because he wanted to do things right and took longer than the higher ups wanted him to. They wanted code pushed out the door. No programming jobs are going to be easy. If you want something that is easier, go into graphic design. You won't make any money in it, as in maybe 25-35k a year because everyone and their mother can pick up html and css without much trouble (much lower barrier to entry). Only the people who have proven themselves can ask more money really.

1. How long do I have budgeted for my speaking?

- Probably about 30 minutes 

2. What will you be speaking about prior to it?

  	- I will discuss the new 3.2 features generally and the new path match syntax specifically. I will probably speak for about 20 
	minutes before you. 

3. Should I expect people to follow along or will this be merely a demo? (and so should the Meetup synopsis ask attendees to install anything beforehand).

   	- This will definitely be a mixture of both. I would say do something like this (doesn???t have to be in this order):

           	1) High Level overview of ingest code, discussion of where you got your data (5-10 mins)

				Social Network Data (Facebook)
				Transaction Data (Google Checkout, Paypal, Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Walmart)
				City Data (Census)
				Store Branch Directory (Yelp)


           	2) Discuss the problem that you wanted to solve.  (~5 mins)

				Anyone who wants to make money either needs to either sell something or help someone sell something.

				Suppose I am a small startup that doesn't sell anything, but is merely a product wiki (Epinsons, Productwiki, Newegg) 
				with revenue tied to the revenue of retailers like Best Buy, Target etc. through some kind of partnership or a 
				minority shareholder.

				Maybe people don't want to buy online but will research it. So at the point of research, we can recommend nearby 
				retail outlets where they can get the item nearby. But not just anywhere. We can recommend retailers based on 
				friends who also purchased from these retailers even if they're not the same store.

				Let's illustrate with an example. I want to buy an HDTV.

				http://reviews.productwiki.com/samsung-ln40c610/

           	3) Discuss your strategy to solve the problem using navigation and path patterns (~10 mins)                       

				Stiching together data from the sources we mentioned earlier, we have a linked schema like this:

				/Users/sarnobat/Desktop/git-repo/yEd/objectivity/Infinite_Graph/social_shopping/infinite_graph_db_furniture.graphml

				What would be the simplest way to express the question we are trying to ask?

				Essentially, find paths through all our friends to transactions involving HDTVs and see what retailers are reachable
				from those transactions.

			4) - Lessons Learned and Possible extensions
			
				With huge dataset, you need to prevent the query going astray into infinite loop.			
			
           	5) Demo using visualizer (~5 mins)


4. Can I use my own laptop to present? (May have recording considerations) 
   - You can definitely use your own laptop as long as it works with the gotomeeting and projector


5. If there is a different machine I should use, can I borrow it and test that the code works?
   - Certainly if we need to, I???ll let you know.

Life Goes On (quote from JBL book)

The great poet Robert Frost said he could sum up everything he's learned about life in three words: It goes on.

Only when you realize that the past cannot be changed and only the future remains will you be able to plan that future. It is very easy to know where you want to be, but if you don't know where you are, then you will have an extremely hard time planning a route to get there.

There are counseling offices around the world full of people that want to blame the system for their circumstances. The sun was in their eyes, their shoes were untied, or -- ever popular -- their environment was not conducive to success. For goodness' sake, if Abilene Christian University had not discriminated against me with such silly rules as attending class and making good grades, I would have graduated with honors.

Dr. Carl Jung said, "When you realize that the whole world has problems, then you are on your way to mental health."

Once you realize that you are not the only person in the world who has a mortgage and other problems, then you can figure out a way to a better future. Everyone has problems to deal with; the key to success is how you deal with those problems.

If all your time is spent thinking about how badly life has mistreated you, all your time is spent in the past and you are ignoring your future. You are gravely mistreating yourself, and there won't be any improvement in your situation. However, you can't spend your time patting yourself on the back either, which is also doing your future no good. You simply have to play the hand dealt to you.

Where you are in life, good or bad, there is nothing you can do about it. You can only control where you will be in the future.

// 9 x 9 array
// no row may repeat any number (1-9)
// no column may repeat any number
// each 3 x 3 grid may not repeat any number

// Basic idea: maintain an array of counts for a row and iterate through each element
// For the 3 x 3 case, call a method that takes a start row and column index with an array of counts
// for each number

// Alternative suggestion: check that the counts add up to 1 + 2 + 3 ... +9 ? 
// But this could succeed withotu satisfying the true restrictions. 
// Or could it? It may satisfy the column condition but not the row condition. 
// So the result would be the same but it would not give you much insight as to what is wrong.
// Besides, it doesn't save you any order of complexity. It just reduces the amoung of memory used to

No one else decides whether your life and career have been successful. There is no objective checklist. You create your own criteria (or steal someone else's).

For example, being an Etouch contractor at Google could be regarded by others as no better than a middle aged mother engineer working in the safe but stagnant Oracle or Cisco environment and there would be several legitimate similarities. But I see being a Google contractor as a great blend of being with the smartest geeks and getting exposed to the right way to program (i.e. Embedded Servers, functional programming, dependency injection, mocking). The fact that I earn less money is of no consequence if I don't want it to be.

Earning less money won't be what I worry about. What I'd worry about is making better use of my money than my peers

Bad treatment of people often should not be taken personally, because people are just commodities.

for example, when getting fired, it's simply a part of a company asset reallotment or expenditure cut to get closer to their own goals. It's like an individual deciding not to put sugar in their cereal. They're not "firing" the sugar, which implies that sugar is useless in all contexts. It's just a saving of unnecessary calories that could be better channeled into something else (or simply be unused). But they're not saying that sugar serves no purpose to the world (e.g. it can be used in deserts).
=== ===
fear of failure/rejection

when people say "stop comparing yourself to others" what they really mean is you'll start being successful when you go full speed ahead with your own way of doing things, not when you play catchup to someone else's approach. This is where fear of failure is important - you may initially "fail" in your eyes as others experience rewards before you.

Single criteria fallacy

"People with low self esteem earn less than people with high self esteem" with the implication being that you should rate yourself higher and ask for a higher salary.

But salary is just one component of welfare. It says nothing about job satisfaction, stability, tension etc.

I personally ask for less money because I don't want to be put under pressure to deliver results. I'd rather it be that way given my limitations (that are veryreal, not just perception) than get a higher salary but agonize over the fact I may lose it.

Oscar Wilde famously said, “People these days know the price of everything and a value of nothing


People will always be drawn to the generous, giving person. They breed attraction because they are so warm and inviting. Those who give the most actually end up getting the most of the one thing we all crave: love.

According to The Atlantic, kindness and generosity are key to lasting and successful relationships.

It’s far better to be rich in friendship than rich in money, and true friendship comes from generosity.

No one forgets being given a favor without any pressure to return it. According to a University of Michigan study, the giver ultimately receives more benefit from this interaction than the recipient. You literally will be happier when you start being charitable. It’s a little counterintuitive, but it totally works.

Even though you may not “have it all” in the short term, you will have long-term success. Selfishness produces cheap, lame results;

According to Dr. Kapil Gupta, who writes on the website The Dumb Little Man, “When you love something so deeply that you could not care less whether it leads to success or failure, you are on the right path. Success will not only arise, but she will chase after you like an unrequited lover. Not because you want her to. But because she simply has no choice.”

Being great at something often has a downside. For example, between Washington and Atlanta there were no professional sports teams so mid-atlantic wrestling was big - probably the biggest market apart from New York. Of course, Mid-Atlantic lovers won't talk about the lack of professional sports teams when they rave over how great it was to be a wrestling fan living in that area.

Relating that to personal ability, maybe it's better to be a good generalist like me than outstanding in one area which comes at a cost (like say Maddie Ziegler who outside of dance probably has nothing else praiseworthy in her life)

Many people, myself in included, are in danger of missing out on basic mainstream entertainment because we cut out things we deem unnecessary in an effort to be outstanding, eg in their career. For example, many of my peers don't watch Modern Family. They are missing out.

Iterative
allows you to prototype areas you deem risky or difficult and to use feedback from each stage to modify your design. However, that runs counter to the thinking behind the waterfall approach: Many design teams would view modifying the design after Stage 1 as a failure of their initial design or requirements process. And although a modified waterfall approach does not preclude the use of feedback, it does not facilitate, accommodate, or encourage it. And finally, the desire to minimize risk does not typically drive a waterfall project.

An excellent plan to the wrong goal is a waste of time. So make sure you have the right goal <!-- Your goal when getting married shouldn't be avoid divorce. That's a minimal satisfaction goal.

Divorced people should not overcompensate for the criteria the failed marriage satisfied. <!-- eg getting an ugly wife because previous wife was good looking -->
=== ===

People who are confident in business are confident because they’re comfortable with failure.

People who are confident in their social lives are confident because they’re comfortable with rejection.

People who are confident in their relationships are confident because they’re comfortable with getting hurt.

The truth is that the route to the positive runs through the negative. Those among us who are the most comfortable with negative experiences are those who reap the most benefits.

It’s counterintuitive, but it’s also true. Often we worry that if we become comfortable in our failures — that if we accept failure as an inevitable part of living — that we will become failures. But it doesn’t work that way. Comfort in our failures allows us to act without fear, to engage without judgment, to love without conditions. 

=== ===
People who say you need a clear plan before you begin a project or essay etc. are revisionists. They aren't speaking from experience of how they came to get their product right. They themselves learnt after making mistakes and trying again. Only after the fact to they have a clear plan.

=== ===
Subtask, division of labor fallacy

this is not how the real world works.
e.g. when editing source code, I make a bunch of small unrelated changes that can't be summarized as a single aggregate message when committing but they are not individually important enough to warrant their own (e.g. while writing a new module at work, I do it in horizontal iterations, not in vertical classes).

"The other side" thinking

Owning a home is not all it's cracked up to be. You lose a lot more to income tax and ultimately just end up worse off than if you didn't own at all (at least until retirement). YOu may as well just gradually start owning REITs

Analogously, maybe having children too early isn't all it's cracked up to be. Maybe you just end up losing out on learning opportunities that would enhance your career or state of knowledge (as a lifelong goal, not for money), or maybe you ultimately manage to look after your children mechanically despite age. Maybe waiting a bit longer enables you to save up more money and avoid taking on loans or can afford to send them to better colleges.

phase gate fallacy

assumes the developer is completely capable before they have written a line of code. The real world doesn't work that way. You try a bit, some of it works. You refine your understanding, then get a clearer design in mind. 
How is a developer supposed to write a design document when they've never written any code on it before?
I don't see any criticisms of this in agile literature about waterfall/phase gate approaches but it happens all the time in my experience. Perhaps others are more comfortable with writing design docs without genuinely understanding what they're doing?

when a task takes a long time at work and people ask why, I find it difficult to explain because I don't remember the complexity that is irrelevant to the current solution I'm trying.

=== bureaucracy ===

You earn $80,000 a year. If I pay you 160,000 you will work twice as hard, right? Right?

if it takes 1 woman 9 months to produce a baby, my VP will provide 9 women so that the baby can come after 1 month

=== bureaucracy ===
ivory tower
=== Bureaucracy in organizations ===

Compare this to layered software design which easily devolves into defensive programming with the aim of not
leaking any failure out: if the problem is communicated to the right person, a better solution can be found than if
trying to keep everything “under the carpet”.

• If one actor manages the work another actor is doing, e.g. by passing on sub-tasks, then the manager should
supervise the child. The reason is that the manager knows which kind of failures are expected and how to
handle them.
=== bureaucracy, politics ===

The typical american office employee charged with mentoring or managing is conditioned, through similar-to-me bias, to chew people out (and ultimately fire) junior employees who don't learn through the typical style of information dissemination, rather than help them through their unique learning style to acquire the know-how to perform their expected duties. 

if they were treated as individuals who feel pain rather than as expendible resources, such disrespect would occur less.

=== Career (use this to defend your rate of progress) ===

James Michener was a better writer than Ernest Hemingway because his books are longer. James Michener was a better writer than Ernest Hemingway because he could type 20 words-per-minute faster.

Assessing the effectiveness of writers based on productivity measures makes absolutely no sense.

Productivity measures are meant for tangible, consistently repeatable things, such as how many widgets a machine can manufacture in an hour or how many shirts a person can sew in a day (even the effectiveness in these situations can be challenged, but I’ll leave that for another day).

Productivity measures were never meant to measure the creation of new sources of value such as ideas and innovations. Measuring intangibles like original value is hard, while measuring concrete tangibles is easier, so naturally people gravitate to what is easiest, even when it’s wrong. Better to have some measure rather than nothing—right? As I’ve said before, give me a fuzzy metric of something valuable (an outcome) rather than a precise number for something unimportant (an output) any time.

Unfortunately, productivity mania has followed us into the creative digital age. Too many organizations are still obsessed with productivity measures, which limits their success when using agile delivery to drive business innovations. The new agile metric is velocity, but it’s just lines of code dressed up in new clothing. As many times as agile experts say “use velocity as a capacity indicator, not a productivity measure” velocity inevitably sets teams against teams and undermines both value and quality. Velocity is a quantity measure (output) and they get us in trouble every time.

Stay low on the ladder of inference 
=== When not to ask people questions ===
* When the answer will emerge soon enough
** e.g. manager on paternity leave for 3 weeks. If you're not sure if he'll join the daily standup meeting, you will be tempted to email him and ask. But if you just wait a few days of his leave you'll see whether or not he attends and get your answer.
* When you will cross that bridge anyway in a future discussion (and the issue cannot get overlooked)
** Emailing the seniormost developer for every small question. Instead put what you prefer in the code, and when he comes to do a code review he may not take issue with it. In which case, you get your way and save yourself from subtracting from your questionbank quota. If he does take issue with it, it's no more hassle to him than answering the question by email (you could argue that it's less hassle - since answering your emails is more of a "favor" than doing a code review which is "mandatory").

According to Business Week's Richard Florida, people under the age of 30 change jobs almost once every year and a half 

I don't believe changing jobs frequently ever cost me a job that I wanted

===  ===
Once I have acquired the knowledge about how to undertake a task, I can perform it easily, often even when I am under quite a bit of pressure However, it usually takes me slightly longer initially to learn how to do something.

not asking for help can, of course, have significant implications. There is a need to strike an appropriate balance between asking for assistance and not becoming too dependent on others so as to create a positive impression. It is a balance that I have often struggled to get right.

What I have also found important is, not just asking for assistance when I need it, but being mindful of who I ask! 

Proactively learn as much as you can independently – and new tasks – outside of work wherever possible. This helps prevent asking others for assistance unnecessarily,

If I need to ask somebody for assistance I do so. If I do, I make notes afterwards about what they suggest for future reference to avoid wherever possible going back to them. I also make sure that I thank them and acknowledge their expertise, knowledge and contribution

If you’re able to maintain transparency with your boss(es), they’re much more likely to be understanding if deadlines need to be pushed back.

Why Are People So Obsessed With Their Careers? 

Personally the only reason I work is to pay off bills and survive, and to use the money I earn to do things I enjoy, such as my hobbies and traveling. Once it hit's 5 o'clock I cant wait to be out the door, and the furthest thing from my mind at that point is work. I have a college degree in Business Management and Marketing, and while I could probably find a slightly higher paying job, I am perfectly satisfied with the position I am in. 

If I could choose between Job A which is low stress where I make a reasonable amount of money, or Job B which is better paying job where I constantly work my *** off, is high stress, and I end up working 80hrs a week, I would choose Job A every time. 

It's like the concept, some people live to eat, and some people eat to live. 

Well I work to live, I don't live to work.

====   ====
Most of the people you describe, I've noticed, are men. It's almost never women who approach careers that way. I think part of it is just the way men are socialized and what they're taught is important as men. People are always talking about the messages women receive, and a lot of it is about their value being tied to physical appearance. Well, men receive messages that their value is tied to what they do for a living, material things, how successful they are, how much money they make. I think a lot of men feel like less of a man or like a failure as a person and as a man if they don't have the kind of careers and things that come with them as you described. Many men seem to think being like this is also how they can attract women or how they can be sure they can provide for their families.

It's fine using approximate metrics to get insights, but don't make your subjects consciously work towards those approximate metrics or it will ruin the very reason that those metrics are useful

Brendan Rodgers knows that 79% of the time the team with more possession wins, so he tries to dominate possession hoping to win. (something about the central limit theorem can be applied here to show that it's a wrong reasoning)

** remember how infuriating rechargeable batteries are from brands like Duracell? They run down so quickly, and in some cases just don't charge and you don't know why. Seeing how the number changes will give you an idea what is really happening.

this is why familiar road journeys seem slower than ufamiliar ones. You don't have a sense of how much longer is left. (or is it because points along the journey are harder to recall?)

Strangely, when it's not a physical journey, but say, a journey through time, familiar things go by more quikly

=== ===
Visibility
Headless computers have a lack of it which is the reason I want to buy a mini monitor whether or not I realize it
=== ===

iPad mass web browsing (e.g. Shaadi intensive searching) 
lack of tactile feedback makes this less pleasant. Even a bluetooth keyboad can't help you fully because buttons/links have to be tapped on screen.
This is why by default there are clicking sounds.

=== ===
lack of tactile feedback example
Chevron low budget numeric keypad (you only really know it got pressed when you hear a sound). Half the time the keypress fails to register and you have to push harder which actually ends up getting painful for delicate/bony fingers.

Even the "next" button on iPhone when listening to music.

=== ===
design

for web pages, put the long items at the bottom (e.g. Products and services textarea which has a lot of rows unlike the other ones)

=== ===
good design

instead of asking people for name and date of birth, ask for date of birth and search, and see which results come up. It may become unnecessary to spell "sridhar sarnobat". PAMF pharmacy seemed to be like this. They didn't ask me for the spelling.

Do not give people too many guidelines (e.g. a  template for filling in a technical document with instructions for covering every feasible scenario). There's no way to discern the fundamental parts from the supplemental ones.

affordance, cues

Putting the day name + day number in a date:

e.g. in my weekly report I write Wed 16 Oct 13 to Tues 22 Oct 13 instead of 16 Oct 13 to 22 Oct 13

Affordance?
* make people do something easy before making them do something hard
** e.g. writing code mechanically before code that requires thought and knowledge

The Flip-Pal has a little screen that lets you see that you got a good scan. The wand type doesn't and lets you go home thinking you have a load of material only to find that much of it is bad.

Sindhuja Mallepula.

Well, I know what I feel. But I'm not sure how to find the words for it.

I like her a lot. Whether she matches my preconceived idea of the partner I want I don't recall (at least not emotionally). Or, I do recall them but they just don't loom as large as I thought a couple of days ago.

Slim, tall, fair and agreeable. I knew all these things parametrically before coming to Atlanta. But whether they added up to an overall attraction I didn't know before. I came to Atlanta looking for a bottom line conclusion. And it's a positive one. She has the grace and form of a princess (without being too delicate or bratty).

Her small eyes were my only concern. And when I emerged from the stairwell to meet her in the lobby, she turned around and gave a sincere, classy and secure smile. The only thing that did not match up to my preconceived image of her was just how large a head she has. I don't even need to preface (sufface?) that by saying it was large compared to mine. It is just large for a human being. But is that good or bad? A large feature is naturally what one would look at simply because of the physical space it occupies. When I look at her head at this increased frequency, what do I feel? I see clean, unblemished skin - something neither I nor many girls I've been attracted to can say. Well, there is a beauty spot on her jaw, but on top of the fact it's not in a prime position for the sight of others, what do I or others feel when they see it? Nothing bad. In fact, maybe it increases the feeling of innocence. Only a child would carry such a natural feature without covering it in makeup.

I notice her hair which, as expected, was indeed shorter than normal (just enough to be tied, but barely). While I still think the beauty can be enhanced by lengthened hair, this doesn't diminish my attraction to her. It's still enough for me to run my fingers through before pinching her cheek and kissing, arousing me (a feeling I'm mildly getting just typing this).

She mentioned she uses no cosmetics apart from lipstick. Indeed this was the case and while that enhancement could not be seen in photo, it could in real life (which is why I was eager to make the trip). They gave a smooth, shiny, classy touch to her smile without appearing unnatural or indulgent. Her teeth, seen with her pleasant smile, were perfect despite somewhat large gums that distract when she completes the smiling flex of the cheeks (but not during the flex).

Her voice, in truth, I can't remember. But it was not piercing or non-feminine (unlike other girls who ironically I have liked). It was simply neutral, much like her personality. She never gave me the impression of being pushy. She has a relaxed compactness to her verbal communication and, it turns out, was 95% American. There was little (though not none) by way of cross-breed with an Indian accent; that she would reserve for speaking in her native language.

Enough with the facial features, let's move onto the naughtier analysis (which, if you know me, you'll know I love to talk about). The first day I really couldn't get much idea how prominent any of her sexual areas of interest were. Only the bare skin of her arms was on display. And it was a pleasant sight, displayed most when she was driving. In-keeping with her impeccable-grace-but-not-malnutritioned way, her arms are thin for an adult and again smooth, monotoned clean. Though actually beyond her elbows, she did begin to show signs of humanness. There was some redness and sharp spikes on her upper arms (I think from sunburn rather than say waxing). As in any attraction, such things become good rather than bad.

That wasn't exactly erotic. Let's get naughtier.

She wore a long skirt after changing clothes around noon. The long skirt, lovely as it was, prevented any genuine analysis. 
But she made up for that with a gorgeous figure-hugging top (pink I think). Her waist was even slimmer than I realized. The phrase "hourglass figure" will never be literal, but those perfect rainbow-like concave curves defining her waist were her most memorable feature. When she turned to walk, her hips would draw outwards a mesmerizing curve that protruded at the top and smoothly returned down to her frame. If it had been me, such a mesmerizing yet subtle movement would have been 100% intentional. Knowing what I know about her neutrality and straightforwardness, I'm almost certain that she was not aware of it, not just with me but at any point in her life.

That figure hugging top gave me an excellent profile of her breasts. They were bigger than expected. Being cynical, I'd say she must have been wearing some kind of shapewear. But again, she seemed so pure that she wouldn't resort to such deception. In fact, her cleavage valley (covered in her neck-high top) was bell-curve like, with no unnatural change of direction.

Only the final day, she wore grey cotton pants that were fitting enough to reveal her actual figure but were not skin-tight. So I could observe my favourite feature on women, which if you have had an intimate conversation with me (not many people have actually), you would know that it is the buttocks. Her butt was pleasantly curvy both upwards and downwards. As she walked, again a small smooth wiggle would emerge. Her thin waist really added to the sideways protrusion of her hips. Unlike with other girls who have a more expansive region of flesh on that side, hers were a lot more wide than high. I'm not saying one is better than the other. My hands are big enough to glide over and squeeze either happily.

Purity-wise, her lack of female indulgent traits are refreshing, though they give me pause. How do I please her? Shopping is not something she likes to do, so I can't excite her by taking her to the mall and spending time watching her try clothes on. She's not into cosmetics so I don't get to oblige her with feedback after she tries a new beauty tip. She doesn't even like chocolate so I can't give her an unexpected treat to drool with.

If she finds me good enough to please her then all is well. It almost feels like I don't need to do anything and just be myself. This seems both lame and uninteresting, but more than that it is not me. My brain is always engaged in trying to please people who are special to me.

I part ways with her now at the mercy of her father and face an anxious (?) wait for the results of his reflective evaluation. If I never re-read this, it will be for fear of failing to win over a sweet, pure girl who doesn't (yet) evoke a raw animalistic sexual appetite in me, but is someone I would gladly spend the rest of my life with and be aroused by in a gentle but heartfelt way. The next person to read this may only be he or she who reads the out-takes section of my biography.

Manoj's leadership qualities are outstanding. When working together with him in a volatile Apple environment, he was always the reliable point of contact between myself in the USA and his division in India. Without fail he would ensure everyone got their work done and gave detailed information on a daily basis. I don't know how he does it but his accomplishments speak for themselves, though he is not one to advertise them. I hope he gets the career of his dreams possible because he's earnt it through an unbelievable work ethic and track record of results.

Dear Mandy,

I would just like to say thank you for creating this amazing web page:

    http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/history.html

I'm now in my 30s and though I no longer live in the UK I did all my education there and, like many school students, didn't appreciate the significance of past civilizations on life today - or the plain enjoyment of learning it. 

I'm sure this has taken you a whole career to build such a reference and I just wanted to tell you how your life's work has saved people like me the lifetime of learning it piece-by-piece year-by-year. It allows me the time to pursue the subsequent phase of our endeavors to discover more about our world.

Yours sincerely,

Snehal was a perfect first point of contact for all my employment-related needs that made my job easier. She would always be available to give me information I wanted or mediate with executives in our company, and was always sensitive to privacy to the point I could speak off the record with her about anything. She also seamlessly took up the role vacated by our previous long-time HR head to the point that I had forgotten they were 2 separate people. The only unfortunate part is that I didn't get together for a longer period with her. I hope our next recruiter is as much of a pleasure to work with as her.

Gaurav is the complete package: technically strong, practical in decision making, and most importantly a good communicator of complex concepts. He's also proactive in learning new technologies even if they are not related to his job. He is one of the first people I'd recommend to manage a team of engineers.

In flow, you lose consciousness of the ego
1) The goal is clear, no conflicts (like optimizer job) at every moment during activity
2) Knowing your progress/position/feedback immediately (e.g. no blood while cutting as a surgeon makes you feel good)
3) Matching of challenge vs skill (e.g. tennis game against someone of similar ability)
5) Attention - e.g. can't worry about income taxes while playing piano; "escaping" from reality (like drugs, or being an artist)
6) Control - if you succeed without trying, you're not in control; and not incontrollable (e.g. traffic)
7) Loss of self consciousness - not worrying/monitoring what others think (your ego isn't threatened)

Age 13
At this age, buttocks small sized women. Therefore, there is very little fat distribution. The age of the woman’s body as a whole has not yet formed a beautiful curvature. Puberty when hormonal changes may also contribute to this part a little acne.

Age 20
Hormones that have changed after passing through puberty makes women at this age to have an adult female buttocks. Levels of fat in the buttocks is already quite a lot, so that this body part look more rounded and prominent. At this age butt look tight, unless you already have a child.

Age 30
The beauty of the buttocks has peaked and will start to fall at this age. However, exercise to increase muscle mass in this section will improve its shape. For example, you are diligently doing squats and lunges, then the shape of the buttocks can be seen as well as the age of 20

Some say wearing unbuttoned shirt is unethical, I immediately say: 'I don't give a fuck!' I advice you to say the same! This trend is very easy to do and it looks very sassy, sexy and feminine. What is so special about it? First of all it drives crazy all the men, as the half unbuttoned shirt already shows some of your body and men really wanna see what are you hiding there. Secondly, such widely opened shirt saves you from hot summer days, when it's 86 degrees outside.

It's uber chic and very French-alike, but do not make it too porn-inspired, keep the ladylike side. Try on loose-fit shirts with rolled up sleeves and deep cleavage. This look is best for brunches, home parties and girls talk.

Some women have no qualms about wearing impossibly low-cut tops and baring it all for everyone to see, but many are more reserved when it comes to cleavage. Showing off cleavage can make you feel incredibly feminine and sexy, but if you expose too much, you may also feel a bit uncomfortable. Below, find out some tricks to tastefully showing off your cleavage.

The female breasts and buttocks are extremely potent sexual symbols of feminine beauty.  Firm but well-rounded and shapely breasts and buttocks are powerful signs of a woman's health, youthfulness and ability to procreate.  Their sagging is also one of the first signs of aging as a girl moves in to her mid-20's womanhood.

Archaeology seems to show that 20,000 years ago Stone Age men strongly favoured women with voluptuous breasts and prominent buttocks.  It appears that men looking for a partner ignored skinny women and competed fiercely for females with the shapeliest buxom and bottom.  The experts think that well-presented breasts and buttocks signalled wealth, health and a good diet.

The perceived attractiveness and mating advantage of women with generous buxom and buttocks has almost certainly resulted in a steady increase in these features over the generations - in the fierce  height of evolutions "survival of the fittest", their size and shape must have long ago moved from the realms of physical reproductive necessity to exaggerated exhibitionism to help attract a good mate.

For example only one-third of a female woman's breast tissue is actually associated with milk production - the rest is merely fatty tissue.  Indeed, a large buxom is actually a survival handicap to a woman, but it's also a symbol to men that she must be healthy and fit in order to be able to afford to carry such an unnecessary overhead.

A female becomes very aware of her buxom and its effect on men as she steps out of her adolescence and attains youth.  A girl gets rapid body changes between about 12 and 14 years of age - puberty - and her breasts start showing.  Between about age 14 and 18 her breasts become fully rounded, but are still pert and firm, and they reach their peak in attractiveness.  However, sometimes their growth is stunted due to hormonal imbalance, congenital defects or deficiency of nourishing diet - this reducing the girls attractiveness as a mate.  After 18 the breasts gradually start sagging and lose their tautness from the effects of gravity, increasing age, and (as appropriate) illness, pregnancy, breast feeding, irregular menstruation, and eventually the menopause. 

A similar process applies to buttocks - their attractiveness to men peaks in a girls late teens, thereafter they slowly become less firm and smooth.  Girls in their thirties often start to experience unsightly skin dimpling - cellulite - this condition seems to be strongly related to hormones and in particular oestrogens.

Although exceptionally shapely breasts and buttocks are a gift of nature to a woman, there are a few things that all women can do to maintain whatever she has been endowed with in the best possible condition, in particular regular exercise.  The use of well-fitting brassieres to support the breasts from their developmental years was for a long time also strongly recommended, however recently the medical profession has come around to the opinion that unless very well endowed, bra's actually do little to preserve the shapely curves and firmness of young breasts, aging and heredity characteristics are the primary contributors to eventual breast sagging.  These days the main reasons for wearing a bra are probably social pressures, for improved appearance, personal comfort, and when playing energetic sports.

Of course if all else fails, plastic surgery is now a real option that can dramatically improve a young woman's bust and buttocks, or successfully roll-back the years for an older woman.

Eli5: Why do womens' butts shake when they walk, but mens' butts don't?
submitted 5 months ago by firewall245
I've noticed when my female friends walk, their butts move side to side per step, yet this doesn't happen with my male friends.
8 commentsshare

Women's bodies are structured differently from men's. Wider hips and a lower center of gravity are important for childbirth... but also mean that the act of moving requires shifting weight from right to left as the movement of the legs moves the hips.

That different shape causes the hips to rock from side to side more when walking. Women also tend to put more fat into their behind than men do.

====   ====
Not surprising. For any trait that shows a sexual dimorphism, you're naturally going to find each sex liking the opposite sex's form. Most men are attracted to women, a woman's butt moving in a particular way makes her look more like a woman, thus, most men are attracted to a butt moving that way.

I think it was a Robert Heinlein book I was reading which described a man looking at the back of a beautiful woman, "whose movements would draw the outline of a figure-eight when she walked across the room" .

Another good reference is the movie Some Like it Hot in which Jack Lemmon says upon seeing Marilyn Monroe walking away,"Will you look at that! Look how she moves! It's like Jell-O on springs. Must have some sort of built-in motor or something. I tell you, it's a whole different sex!"

A drama teacher once told my class "To walk like a girl, pretend you're walking along a plank, one foot in front of the other. To walk like a guy, pretend you're walking on two planks, with one foot on each."

A corollary question here: is that particular - and spectacular - twitch of the buttocks when wearing a bikini a conscious behavior? Some women at the beach cock their asses like a loaded gun.

====   ====
Pelvic dimorphism

Women trying to obtain the affection of a man may exaggerate their hip swing to accentuate their hips, which are one of the primary body parts proven to drive a guy wild. A 70% hip to waist ratio is ideal in order for a man to find a woman's body attractive; drawing attention to the width of the hips by swaying them or putting one hand on them increases the likelihood that the woman would be found attractive. 

====   ====
Females in humans have wider hips, for childbirth. Thus the way they walk is different, and it seems like their ass "rolls" around. It's basically to compensate their wider hips.
===  ===
What I learned, was that typically men walk with their shoulders forward in an almost hunched posture. This cause their elbows to pivot outward and gives them the appearance they are more aggressive (which may be evolutionary). Conversely, most women walk more upright with their shoulders back and elbows inward. This posture gives a softer more relaxed look. Adapting this later posture was for me far more achievable and posed less risk of looking fake. Once I was able to do this comfortably I found that it also enhanced other feminine actions that I already did naturally, one of these things was ironically a slight hip sway!

=== ===


The female body is a work of art. The male body is utilitarian. It's for getting around. It's like a Jeep.
===  ===

So yesterday I was smelling a few girls I decided to take it another step, at first I started hugging girls and I also noticed that they were so soft, their like made out of jelly or something, I swear when this girl hugged me all I wanted to do was to just hug her softness out of her, coupled with the fact that girls smell awesome I was in heaven for 5 seconds.

Because women have a higher fat body percentage than men. And fat is more cushiony than muscle.

===  ===
Soft
Soft- The act of being gentle in a female way so as to avoid physical conflict. 
Most soft people are normally little girls and enjoy sitting and or cuddling with stuffed animals. Boys/Dudes/Men can range from anywhere between Soft to Tender, Tender being the softest of softs. This means you speak like a little bitch, saying adorable one liners to girls, and do cutsie things such as holding hands and blushing over girls. 
Being soft isnt normally a bad thing, seeing as you can sometimes get ass, or snag bitches with such qualities. Girls like soft dudes, as they are normally extremely romantic. These are actually the guys who put their expensive as fuck jackets in mud puddles, because the girl is too retarded to walk around them. Will also cuddle with girls during The Dark Knight, because Batman is the ultimate god of Pillows, and all that is Tender.

This choice of footwear will make your butt and boobs protrude further from your body. This is because heels have a way of changing the natural curve

Boobs are an extension of girls being soft, tender and inviting.

And we all know how high school girls like to lie to make themselves older. Since when can 13-year-olds wear makeup and miniskirts? I mean, I’ve never been of the opinion that girls are “asking for it” by dressing in a provocative fashion, but when a 13 year old looks like these did, most guys couldn’t help but find them attractive.  It’s a problem.
===  ===
I love licking them and sucking on them. Idrk why for sure, but it's just fun.

The reason WE WOMEN fall in LOVE when our nipples are sucked is that OXYTOCIN kicks in and it MAKES US FALL IN LOVE

The sexiness of an outfit is directly proportional to the possibility that a vital piece of it might fall off.

what makes clothing sexy is the potential for a catastrophic Wardrobe Malfunction

a woman who is not quite naked is more interesting than a woman who already is.

alcohol releases endorphins in your brain. I'm not sure exactly which one, but its a mood stabalizing endorphin, such as seretonin or norepenephrin. Over time, your body adapts to the increase in this endorphin and starts to release less and less naturally. Pretty soon, your brain is not producing enough on its own to function, so you need to drink alcohol so more will be released so you feel 'normal'.

???Yes, plain old chewing gum. The simple act of chewing on a stick of gum can suppress your appetite, thereby preserving limited food supplies from overindulgence, while aiding in necessary saliva production. While it will not substitute for a turkey dinner, and despite the common myth about its digestive properties, a stick or two also can be used in a pinch for short-term nutrition.??????

Why tables must have foot rests (or you should get one) even if your legs touch the floor
Your hamstring wants stretching if you've been sitting upright for a long time with the knee at 90 degrees.
Since you don't have a foot rest usually, you end up using a bad posture so your feet can reach and rest on something like a computer tower or cabinet off to the side
Your back is curved rather than at 90 degrees

Krupa Karanam
ok sridhar.
bye, talk to you later.9:01 PM



===  ===
Reasons why its better for krupa to go
* i could get in trouble for physical attack (mom kept warning me to control myself which is tiresome)
** I can't guarantee I'll never touch Krupa under extreme circumstances and bad behavior of hers

=== ===
Unconditional love

I never thought you were being irrational.


Permanently Attached

No baby, I always want to talk to you. I never intend to stay quiet or ignore you if you???re angry. I thought I???ve been emailing you daily the last 7 days. I know some days the contents of my emails are dull, but I insist on mailing you every day. Did I not reply to something properly?

I don???t want to ever get back to the state where we were disconnected and unattached. That was a horrible phase that I don???t want to experience again. All I meant was that if you don???t want to talk to me because I misbehaved, I will not make get defensive, make excuses or deny doing wrong. But I will still keep mailing you like I have done (I would call or text you but most of the time I can???t get through to you).

Krupa

I wasn't the one who shut the machien down. Every time I tried to login it rejected my password. One time out of 100 I was able to login but before I could even click on internet  explorer the computer just logged me out again. After trying to log in a couple more times and failing, I shut the computer down and was advised by the manufacturer, against my wishes, to take it to the store and get it serviced. The store took it, and never returned it to me and just said "we can't fix it. Buy a new one. And you're not getting your money back."

=== Reasons to feel good if Krupa leaves (tags: let Krupa go) ===
Thoughts that will cheer me up if I feel sad when Krupa leaves. Reasons why it's a good idea for Krupa to go (not a list of what I don't like about Krupa - I don't hate her ways. Just things that you'll feel hurt about if she stays. It's to counterbalance feeling upset when the divorce is official)
* she'll resist intercourse then blame my credentials later (and I'll feel hurt having to accept the blame when I was trying to prevent it from happening)
* THERE WILL BE LESS CHANCE OF A COLD MARRIAGE - if you say a word to her that she has to change, she'll give you the silent treatment for years and blame it all on me for opening my mouth
* SOMEONE ELSE WILL NOTICE THE NICE THINGS YOU GIVE HER - whenever you show your love it goes into a black hole (flowers, amazon gift card, going into 7-eleven to get chips for her)
** but if you don't do it she'll behave distant all the time
* YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A SYNCHRONOUS DIALOGUE she won't respond to your messages in a timely fashion and you'll feel hurt/foolish
* THERE WILL BE LESS CHANCE OF THREATS THAT MAKE YOU GIVE FALSE APOLOGIES - you'll feel threatened with her packing her bags all the time each time you open your mouth
* YOUR WILL BE SPARED THE NEED TO REPEATEDLY EXPLAINING THE TRUTH TO CALM YOUR MOTHER'S PARANOIA - mom feeling it necessary to lecture me about the danger of violence
* YOU WON'T BE THOUGHT OF AS THE ONE WHO WAS WRONG - father still blames me for the lack of intercourse
* YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THE LARGE FAMILY YOU WANT - I just can't see having 3 children with her
* YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET CRITICIZED WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST - If she comes, she will not contribute anything to the household (like children or a job) but will criticize the furniture and the mess in the house
* YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE RUDE/NASTY TO GET COOPERATION (FOR WHICH YOU'LL GET BLAMED FOR LATER TOO) - When my mom tried to speak to her directly rather than speak to her parents and make a stern stance, Krupa didn't reply. It's this kind of elusion by phone that is disrespectful and enough is enough. If you try to be nice, she takes advantage of it. Don't feel like a villain for her crying when not picking her call.
* YOU'RE REDUCING THE CHANCE OF DIVORCE LATER - After 6 months again she will want to leave (actually I think I can manage her but it's a possibility)
* IT'S BETTER THAN DIVORCING AFTER HAVING A CHILD

Letting her back into your life after thinking all these things is not hypocrisy. It's being flexible and at peace with whatever happens
Bottom line - either way I get what I want.


== Learning ==
===  ===

Learning by grouping

this is why an organization with items that are prearranged is harder to learn (e.g. source code that is in packages)

=== ===

Rudraksha Shah, Learning is a never ending cycle, important part is to retain whatever you need.

=== ===

how to help kids learn spanish

listen to Cumpleanos de ti (Atleti)

=== ===
childhood = when you make a mistake, you should accept punishment (and fear making mistakes in future)
adulthood = when you make a mistake, you should forgive yourself and adapt your approach (and learn through trial and error)

in other words, what is healthy for adulthood is discouraged in childhood

=== ===
Learning

Finding patterns
e.g. XReactor sequence diagram looked overwhelming until I saw the pattern that almost all calls resulting from a connection were to create actors 

=== ===
Learning through diffs
Chrestomathy
=== ===

Double loop learning vs single loop learning
Feedback
Aliases or Bash key bindings don't print the command. Zsh key bindings do. So you become more familiar with the command so you can use it directly or modify it (it's a white box rather than black box)

=== ===
Learning through diffs

I can't understand an apache license or a GPL license, but if you tell me the differences between the 2 I will know the important things.

rationale: If it's the same everywhere, there's no benefit in knowing it. 
** Hmmm, I wonder if this also means the model is a sound one for which you don't need to know the internals if it doesn't differ across implementations (I'm thinking of sun's non-annotation-based http server vs jetty + jersey annotations embedded http server - you don't need to learn the sun version before )

=== ===
Productivity/Winning/Learning - excellence
(Learning through diffs?)

Question: How did we arrive at this complex system of working components (e.g. Maven array of projects with complex dependencies)
Answer: Piece by piece. So when understanding something complex, start with the simplest seed by removing secondary, tertiary etc concerns.

This is also why learning history is good. You get to learn how things were derived.

=== ===
Role models, learning from people around you 

Without people around us who do things right, we never learn how to do things because what we currently know doesn't seem wrong
* e.g. Nick is very friendly with all colleagues at all levels, all functions. Without seeing how he does things I probably wouldn't chit chat with the HR person as much.

=== ===

"become a teacher and you will be taught" (by your students)

=== ===

truth isn't as important as a consistent narrative that you find easy to remember.

UCSC kernel professor says how textbook material is outdated cut and paste fro the internet and no longer correct. That's fine with me. It's more important that I get the core model correct and find it easy to remember. If I try and learn the absolute latest it will be difficult to obtain after the class ends when I have more free time to learn it at my on pace. But a book with an internal logic / story to believe in (like Wade Keller says with wrestling) will be the most rewarding experience over the course of a career.

don't let the incorrectness of the book be a decoy to do nothing at all (though if the absolute latest material is conveniently available then by all means use that instead)
=== ===
1-weekend courses are not good for learning long term because you miss out on long term repetition which is key to remembering
They are just made for the convenience of part-time instructors who are still payed highly. Customers probably don't have much value gained (even if they are willing to pay out of naivety)
=== ===
when it comes to my memory, pictures are also flypaper for memory. Whenever the term that maps to the diagram gets mentioned, whatever subsequent information gets shared on that "sticks" to the diagram.

Took an instant love to Spanish soccer after hearing about Valencia beat Barcelona. Italian soccer had been mind-numbingly boring that I'd seen on Channel 4 in 98-99. The 99-00 CL season which saw 3 spanish teams finish in the laset 4 vindicated my allegiance.

Our richness compared to other residents manifested itself in subtle ways, though we didn't knowingly flaut anything. We also were rarely first to get them. We would usually react to what others were flaunting.

Having more transformers toys and videos, being able to play arcade games more often and get further by spending more on them.

Completing the Turtles arcade game spending about 10 GBP was a once in a lifetime experience for me and Prakash.

1996 
Seeing girls in large numbers after 4 years in a mostly boys school was both intriguing but intimidating. In an era of feminist reform I was expecting a lot of backlash and humiliation from powerful confident, classy and above all successful women. To some extent there was indeed. But slowly it would turn out that was a lot of undignified female students too and I felt less threatened.

Dear sir,

Thank you for your prompt response with the biodata and photos.

This weekend we have some personal matters to attend to in Pune. On Monday we will confirm that our intention to meet you and arrange a day and time.

May I ask where in Bangalore your family would meet us? This will allow us to plan our travel.

Okay. Well, the chances of us happening are not high enough for you to continue chatting with me, I feel. I can't keep accepting how nicely you talk to me with me not reciprocating. I've been on the other side of that fence in the past and it's not fair on you.
I don't want to hurt you but I want to minimize your pain

Madhumitha
Okay, but would you mind letting me the reason for this?

me
the timeline is just not one i'm comfortable with...
i'm finding it too stressful
and it's a lot of time commitment

Madhumitha
so you are deciding to get married next year or so?

me
no, it's just that I can't offer you a strong enough guarantee (i.e. more than 50% chance)  to warrant wasting your time
Being a girl you're even more under pressure to get settled than I am
if you were willing to talk to multiple proposals at a time I'd have no problem
but I can't knowingly waste your time like this

Madhumitha
that's not your fault
at any cost i won't blame you for that  :-) don't worry
it was my decision
even my parents know that

Hi Raksha. It's nice to hear from you. Your mom was kind enough to return my call very soon after I called. Since I don't know much Kannada (I was born and raised abroad), I've asked my mom Meenakshi Sarnobat to call your mom I'm not sure when she'll do it because she's a bit busy, but if you all don't hear from her soon she can be reached at 0044 292 048 8716. I'm happy to speak to you directly via phone, whatsapp, email etc. any time but I understand you may not want to do so yet. Best wishes, Sridhar

=== Timeline of previous marriage  ===
<!--(so mom or I can explain to other brides' families)-->
# Sridhar was a green card holder, and it would have taken 5+ years for her to obtain a wife's green card
# So she applied for a master's degree in the US so she could come as a student, but there were no suitable programs nearby
# She only got accepted to a program 4000km away (3000 miles) and we gave her money to study there
# They got married and she moved to the USA, then she stopped staying in daily contact and would spend her time with her roommates and other boys, 
# She would argue about things and disconnect Sridhar's calls. Then she told Sridhar she didn't want to be with me anymore and never let him visit (she wouldn't give him her new address so we didn't know where she stayed).
# Her parents and us tried for years to convince her to visit but she wouldn't move here and took a job there instead. Her parents told me it was best to look for another girl.
# We lost a lot of money (40 Lahks)

Dear Anamika, Thanks for your message. Could you pass on my reply to Sridhar as follows:Hello Sridhar,Let me start by writing this, I am impressed by the way you have described yourself. It needs a lot of insight. But what really makes me want to know you is your idea about what you want in a partner. "sometimes you just end up liking someone that you hadn't imagined before you saw them beautiful and so true.My profile (;R1897260); will give you information that people many times care to know about before actually knowing a person. To give you a slight further insight, I can talk or carry on a conversation but can actually communicate only if I get a comfortable vibe. I could be a talkative shy person if it makes sense. I would like to talk to you. If you feel the same, contact me on pw3763@gmail.com. We could exchange numbers if we decide to talk further. I am in the Bay area. It seems we wish similar things.Regards,Shilpa	. Less

Hello, this is Sridhar. I really like the bride's profile. Only thing is I have been speaking to someone else too for a few months. If you are comfortable with that I'd be happy to discuss more. If not, you are welcome to get back to me in the future if she is still available.

=== Priya Dash first meeting ===
2016-01-01

I just met Priya for the first time today - a Happy New Year indeed. After minor worries including her not picking my call, we met in the hall way of her apartment.

My first impressions were positive without being artificially vivid. She looked cute, having done her hair and lips nicely and not overdressing. She was relaxed and cheerful. I, as usual, was anxious and micro-conscious about my image. I don't think she was stunned when she saw me, but that was because, as I learned, she's just relaxed by nature.

I was at ease with her just like over chat (except the times I was worried she'd lost interest). She'd never leave a silence hanging. Though as usual I revealed way more than a normal person would, just to hold her interest.

My biggest memory is how physically resilient she is. She raised no issue with the coldness beyond how it would affect me. When she was saying we could walk along the waterfront I was alarmed since it was freezing cold outside the hotel. She didn't go to any ridiculous extents the way I do by way of thermal accessories. A coat and that was it, hood not put on. No gloves, unzipped, no hat, just long free hair partially covering her ears. I almost had to tell her she's going to get cold, at which point she zipped her coat up and put her hands in her pocket.

The waterfront was warmer than inland. I'm not going to attempt to provide a narrative for that. I've never seen New York so tranquil. Barely a car or person in sight either where we were walking, or across the Hudson river in the dark picturesque Manhattan Skyline.

It was always difficult to impress her. There seemed to be nothing she was passionately for or against. Just innocently welcoming to whatever comes her way.

I was happy when she asked to see my photographs, and either was sincerely interested or very diplomatic about indifference towards it.

For better or worse, we stumbled upon the album of her I has been maintaining. Of course, she did nothing more than laugh but unless I get the opportunity to know her better I will not know whether more sinister feelings lurked beneath her skin.

I could see she had that chubby face, which was something I would have preferred not to be there. But her personality was so sweet as sugar that I couldn't help but immerse myself in that and not her features. I did notice she had quite pouty lips, decorated with a dark red with an intoxicating cherry scent reinforcing the sweetness.

As usual there was the important metric I had to capture as part of my evaluation of a female I liked: the butt test. Days before I had resigned myself to her having a small, diminutive butt. I was happy to discover that she did have enough for me to fantasize about holding and squeezing. By no means was it disproportionately oversized inkeeping with her facial chubbiness, but like I've said in the past I don't think I've ever seen a pretty girl's butt I didn't like.

She had large dangling earrings which enhanced her beauty. Though I hope not too much.

What more to say? Not much. Just that she is sweet and easy to get along with and will never miss an opportunity to laugh. Long may that continue.

I'm not wagging my tail and drooling like I might with some other girls, but that's okay. My love for her is based on her visual cuteness, and sweet personality.

=== getting over in wrestling natural lifecycle ===
==== Failure ====
debut as an unknown - will not be spectacular success or failure
after a few appearances - audience will get bored, feel excluded and start booing to have their existence acknowledged
==== Success ====
debut as a heel - audience try to decide if they like you or not
after a few appearances - audience will boo because they don't like your repeated behavior
after several months - audience will enjoy booing you so much because you give them the opportunity to get involved and be heard. They'll start appreciating you obliging them.

debut as a face with a reputation (e.g. as a great wrestler from another promotion or someone with impressive ability; vignettes are tricky because if the live experience doesn't match the pre-tapes then the audience will feel let down)

For the people on the front lines our ???five-dollar words??? must seem like a completely different language. Imagine sharing this gem at your next town-hall meet- ing: ???If we leverage core competencies across the value chain and maximize synergistic opportunities among strategic alternatives, we may be able to reach EVA targets.??? How can someone who will leave that meeting and meet with a customer an hour later act on that statement?

marketing
Stickiness through Backlinking - every touchpoint must have a way to navigate back to the mainland
* counter example - when you go to a pdf of a free chapter, and that pdf doesn't tell what book it's from there's no way for the visitor to buy the whole book

Stickiness - you must always allow people to hop from one item to another so that they have the chance to hone in on what they're looking for. Otherwise they'll bounce.
e.g. Amazon - "related products"

=== ===
Transparency (or lack of)
One of the biggest mistakes you can make as an executive is not be transparent about your decisions.
People will only do what you tell them if you educate them about why it's that way (remember I got yelled at by some bitch when I asked why I had to be quiet about something)
It's like telling someone not to push a red button. Several people will. But if you tell people not to push the red button because it will open the aircraft escape door then they know it will be in  their best interests to cooperate
A more realistic example: telling employees not to compromise trade secrets. If they understand that it will give competitors and advantage, sales will be lost, and people will get layed off, employees are much more likely to cooperate

Primitive Parents (e.g. Indian parents!) are also bad about this. They tell kids they must study and forbid them from watching TV, with coercive authority. It would be more effective and less resentful if they explained to their children that if they don't do well in school, they will not get into good colleges, and if they don't get into good colleges they won't get good jobs and if they don't get good jobs they won't have as much money, and if they don't have as much money they can't buy toys (or games, or cable TV etc)

Polite, mild-mannered, honest,   humble,   responsible, family-oriented, academic.   Want children. Come from a well-educated family (both parents are retired doctors). Have an MBA degree. Born and raised in UK, settled in California. 

Here are some of my defining behaviors:

POSITIVE
- If I can't say something nice, I don't say anything at all
- I always say please and thank you, especially to strangers
- I do not criticize unless I can do better
- I avoid unpleasant confrontations and think of the negative consequences of being rude
- I give people the benefit of the doubt if they make a mistake
- I can be very funny after overcoming initial shyness, but I avoid hurting anyone's feelings

NEGATIVE (if you have different priorities in life)
- I don't maintain an artificially inflated image of superiority that equates to being pretentious
- I love chatting with and playing with children, and buying gifts for my little cousins
- I get pleasure learning new things and value investing in knowledge
- I want to invest enough money in education for my children so that they can enjoy the same advantages that I did
- I'm very sensitive, my feelings can get hurt by people who speak crudely
- I feel guilty if I have to say no to anything or lie to people I respect

=== Choosing stock music ===

* Remember the objective of music is not to show people how cool you are. It???s mostly to transport people back to that time (and location). Occasionally to elicit an emotion (e.g. tension, sadness, euphoria, relief) - though European style doesn???t exaggerate it the way American sports does so think about your audience.

It's a very significant moment in WWE divas history. Eve was the last of the major alpha female "eye candy" 6ft bikini models that WWF started hiring around the beginning of the Monday Night Wars (EDIT - and stopped hiring around 2009).

The last 2 years or so they've been hiring women based more on athletics or charisma, which SHOULD make most of us happy. But I personally prefer the Candice Michelle, Kelly Kelly, Bella Twins, Tiffany types over AJ, Aksana, Kaitlyn and whoever else is left on the roster.

One thing I've noticed - it seems 99% of divas has a shelf life between 5-7 years: Trish (2000-2006), Eve (2007-2013), Sable (1996-2003), Torrie (2001-2008). It's unfortunate for women that when they do not have the 20-something look, their ability to draw falls a lot. I'm glad that Vickie has given hope for a lot of women out there. And Ashley gave birth even before winning the diva search.

sarnobat story

Mom had trouble lifting slabs when doing garden DIY (though I thought we didn't move to Tan-y-fron until we knew Priya was coming).

Mom had migraine after dropping prakash for Monkton entrance exam. Was in Newport Road, took some kind of medicine that was used for abortion. Was 19 weeks pregnant with Priya. Tested for Down's Syndrome and faced agonizing wait for results (abortion would have been mandatory if the tests came back positive).

(Interpretation: this person is asking a rhetorical question with the semantics "So Murali, you don't believe you can completely abstain from alcohol and its consequences because once the bodily systems are affected, they can never be fully detoxed")

Interpretation B: "It seems like you're saying, Murali, that the discovery of the (positive) effects of alcohol cannot be forgotten and will always lure you back so the target of being sober for a lifelong period is not realistic."

And I said that I was moving from SF to San Jose and none of my friends are down here, and I needed at least tgo be close to someone I knew and I can trust

=== The 16 Basic Desires ===
The following is the list of basic desires recognized by Reiss’ sensitivity theory of motivation. Each of these desires is largely unrelated to all others. Each forms a continuum between high and low motivation. High motivation indicates that the desire is intensely and frequently experienced, whereas low motivation indicates that the desire is weak and infrequently experienced.

==== Acceptance ====
is the desire for approval. When this desire is satisfied, people feel self-confident and happy. When the desire is frustrated, people feel insecure and unhappy. Acceptance is most commonly satisfied when parents accept their children. To a lesser extent, it can be
satisfied by close friendships and intimate relationships. It is most
commonly frustrated by parental rejection. High acceptance desire
leads to concern with issues of criticism and rejection. Low acceptance
desire suggests a high capacity to tolerate criticism and rejection.

==== Curiosity ====
is the desire for truth or knowledge. This desire is commonly satisfied by exploration or learning. When the desire is fulfilled, people feel enlightened. High curiosity is associated with exploration, whereas low curiosity is associated with experiencing little interest in learning.

==== Eating ====
is the desire for food. It is commonly satisfied by preparing
and consuming meals. People with high eating are attentive to food,
whereas those with low eating are much less attentive to food than the
average person. Eating is associated with feelings of hunger.

==== Family ====
is the desire to raise one’s own children. It does not include a general desire for nuturance; it is limited to taking care of one’s own. When this desire is satisfied, people experience love. High family desire is commonly satisfied by centering one’s activities around one’s children. Low family desire is commonly satisfied by not having children.

==== Honor ====
is the desire to be loyal to one’s parents, ethnic group, or heritage. It includes the desire to show character and behave morally, as defined by traditional codes of conduct. This is the desire that connects people to their parents and ancestors. The desire is most commonly satisfied by behaving in accordance with traditional codes of conduct, following ethnic or family tradition. When people behave honorably, they feel loyal and possibly righteous. High honor is associated with moralistic behavior and concern with character. Low honor is associated with unscrupulous behavior and a lack of loyalty.

==== Idealism ====
is the desire to improve society. It is commonly satisfied by becoming involved in social causes. When this desire is satisfied, people feel that the world is just. High idealism is associated with humanitarian activities, whereas low idealism is associated with a lack of interest in societal affairs.

==== Independence ====
is the desire for self-reliance or what is sometimes called autonomy. This desire is commonly satisfied by doing things on one’s own without assistance from others. When this desire is satisfied, people feel free. People with high independence desire dislike needing others, whereas those with low independence desire enjoy being connected to others or a greater reality. Low independence desire is associated with romantic love.

==== Order ====
is the desire for a predictable environment. It includes the desire for cleanliness and ritual. It is commonly satisfied by rituals, traditions, cleanliness, and organizing activities. When this desire is satisfied, people feel that their lives are predictable. High order is associated with rule-governed and compulsive behavior, whereas low order is satisfied by preferences for disorganization, flexibility, and ambiguity.

==== Physical exercise ====
is the desire to move one’s muscles. This desire is commonly satisfied by physical activity such as sports or vigorous work. When the desire is fulfilled, people feel fit. High physical exercise is associated with a need for activity, whereas low physical activity is associated with avoidance of physical activity.

==== Power  ====
is the desire to experience influence or what is sometimes called self-efficacy or competence motivation. This desire is commonly satisfied by achievement, leadership, or domineering behavior. When this desire is satisfied, people feel competent and influential. High power desire is associated with ambition, workaholism, or dominance; low power desire is associated with a lack of ambition or submission.

==== Romance ====
is the desire for sex, including the desire for beauty. It is commonly satisfied by romantic love. When this desire is experienced, people feel lust. High romance is associated with sensualism, whereas low romance is associated with asceticism.

==== Saving ====
is the desire to collect and own things. A high desire for
saving is associated with hoarding, including hoarding money. People
with a high desire to save hate wasting anything. A low desire for
saving is associated with spendthrift behavior.

http://web.iaincirebon.ac.id/ebook/indrya/Motivation/%5BHarvey_N._Switzky%5D_Personality_and_Motivational_D(BookFi.org).pdf
==== Social contact ====
is the desire for interaction with other people. The desire for play or fun falls under this desire because of the primal association between play and social contact. This desire is commonly satisfied by socializing with others through friendships, parties, clubs, or events. When this desire is satisfied, people have a sense of belonging. High social contact is associated with fun-loving behavior, whereas low social contact is associated with a desire for privacy and aloneness.

==== Status ====
is the desire for social standing. (The desire for attention falls
under this desire). When this desire is satisfied, people feel worthy and
important. Status is most commonly satisfied by seeking wealth or
prestige, such as wearing expensive clothes, living in exclusive
neighborhoods, or joining exclusive clubs. People with high status are
attentive to issues of class, wealth, and prestige. People with low status
are inattentive to class, wealth, and prestige.

==== Tranquility ====
is the desire to be free of anxiety, frustration, or pain. It is associated with feelings of relaxation and calm. People with high tranquility tend to behave fearfully and experience anxiety frequently; those with low tranquility tend to be adventuresome.

==== Vengeance ====
is the desire to get even with others. This desire is commonly satisfied through participation in competitive activities, interpersonal competitiveness, or aggression. When this desire is satisfied, people feel vindicated. High vengeance is associated with aggressive behavior, whereas low vengeance is associated with peacekeeping behavior or kindness.

problems with categorization (implications for creating cheat sheets)

interesting things get buried under layers of vague associations
=== ===
coagulate - store md5 hashes of files

maybe even do this for webpages, but I can see matches being fuzzy e.g. wikipedia pages that evolve, or branding changes). If this problem could be solved, people could refer to web content by permalinks. I guess you need to create unique IDs from titles. Or some kind of composite of a URL plus a title. Maybe also use levenstein distance
=== ===

categorization can be done 3 ways (in any combination) using yEd

* clusters/groupings
* arrows 
* node color

e.g. for "categories_cheat_sheets.graphml":
* groups - parent category
* arrows - see also
* color - media type - one of wiki/email/pdf (actually I haven't used colors yet)

=== ===
coagulate

sort order
* Reverse creation time - in theory this is good because long tail items don't undermine sortable ones
* in practice it's better to randomize, because some recent items you just don't know how to sort and have to scroll past them EVERY time.

=== ===
productivity

If a large number of items have contents that are approximately the same, chances are they're not important (e.g. GTT monitoring alerts)

=== ===
I remember also some more stages to getting interested in writing my own apps

I had started with (attempting to) write cheat sheets that show the similarities in web application file structure via WebObjects (RSSAdmin.woa), Spring jar files, simple servlet projects from Maven archetypes and how web.xml specifies mappings.

I might have tried and failed to understand how GWT apps do it too.

Once I realized you could bypass all that crap with Groovy, I started getting the chance to write my own apps (first of which was yurl 18 months later).
=== ===
Yurl is "subtractive" so you get a lot of false positives, and quality is low
Media is meant to be "additive" so you only get high quality results (though initially you will have a lot of false negatives)

coagulate is subtractive
favorites is additive
=== ===
#funology

learning history (particularly early 1900s in America - e.g. mass communication? I can't remember)

=== ===

The key problem with my apps is how best to handle favorites (or more generally ranking). At the moment I simply make a copy into a different place. (coagulate doesn't support this yet)
But the more sophisticated approach is to use the pyramid approach or the yurl timestamp ranking (has its own problems)

"If I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.???
In other words, the decoy effect is at play. When you commit to doing one thing, you give up the choice of doing another. In other words, there is an opportunity cost to committment.

funology

like a squeaky toy, responsive user interface, musical instrument or a computer, computer hacker, or a disruptive child, there's a satisfaction in doing something that has an effect from which your controllable action has a cause.

pareto
to discover new things

e.g. instead of buying 5 packs of noodles of your favorite kind, buy 4 of them, and 1 that you've never tried before. You might find something new that you like
(this is assuming there are so many types of noodles that you haven't tried or definitely can't try)

This relies on acceptance of the possibility that the one experimental one will be a total waste (and by law of averages it will be)

But they may exceed your expectations in other areas to the point (e.g. Teju. she's cute to the point that what you thought was a minimum is actually not what really attracts you to them
** insufficient knowledge: you might insist on someone who is not a Brahmin. But other castes may be just as good but you don't know the taxonomy of castes well enough.

Grouping

On a particular page of a photo album, try and keep all the photos that are landscape together and all the photos that are portrait together, to prevent switching back and forth
* but this only applies at a photo level. At a page level you should group by topic, place or time
** You wouldn't have your portrait photo pages first in the album, and the all your landscape photo pages at the end of the album (your cat pictures would get split into 2 locations).

=== ===
Why a flip photo album is nicer than sheet protectors

even if you can see many many photos in a single view on sheet protectors, flipping is painfully heavy (the sheets are huge compared to flipping an individual photo) and requires you to move your whole arm rather than just fingers (or wrists, in the case of single-page albums)

"It only takes 5 minutes"
Are these the same people that don't have 5 minutes to keep in touch once every 6 months? I mean, 24 hours x 30 days x 6 months x 60 minutes = some large number of minutes which presumably they can spare 5 of because I'm so important to them?

Categorization is frequently not mutually exclusive and requires some lenience

Something may qualify as both belonging to either category without any preference. You just have to pick one using a consistent strategy

(e.g. email qualifying as "Mass" or "System Generated". It  may be human written so belongs in mass, but is sent so such a huge group of recipients that you may as well make it 'system generated' for all intents and purposes )

=== ===
Pipelining

If engine installation takes 20 minutes, hood installation takes 5 minutes, and wheel installation takes 10 minutes, then finishing all three cars when only one car can be assembled at once would take 105 minutes. On the other hand, using the assembly line, the total time to complete all three is 75 minutes.
 
As the assembly-line example shows, pipelining doesn't decrease the time for processing a single datum; it only increases the throughput of the system when processing a stream of data.

For remote desktop, make sure you have a mouse rather than a trackpad (those slow feedback loops drive your fingers crazy)

Subtractive vs additive

subtractive (everything initially visible) - marking emails as read
additive (nothing initially visible) - moving a message to a folder, starring a message

problems
* subtractive - false positives in incoming bucket (things are unread that don't deserve to be until you make the effort to correct it)
** bad for browsing
* additive - false negatives in target bucket (things are not in the right folder that deserve to be until you make the effort to correct it)
** bad for searching

when you have multiple items
while adding extra info helps you, it makes it harder to pack multiple items into a space
(e.g. a menu of all Google cafes. icons indicating contains pork etc. are helpful, but
a spreadsheet with less names but packing every single cafe into a single screen space
is even higher return on asset)
Think also how this applies to Yurl views.

=== ===
productivity

Purge
duplicate/redundancy removal
if an item is used as a cue to do something, make sure there aren't redundant entries that are meant as cues for the same action
* For example, you may have a Google Doc invitation to edit email notification, and another email from an actual person saying what to do with that document. You can mark one as read.

Batching is not only for databases

I am sure that most of you are familiar with the concept of query batching. In short, you ???batch??? a lot of similar DB queries and send only one request in the database which allows for better performance. Optimization at its best. Guess what, you can use the same principles for your own tasks! WIth that way, you will minimize the activation costs and various overheads that come with certain tasks. Good examples of tasks that batching can be applied to are e-mail checking (notice a pattern here?), phone calls and generally any menial, repetitive work.

categorization is always a lossy process. You can't retain all the important facts.
e.g. When creating a treemap of the S&P500, AAPL is put in the 'consumer goods' subtree and not the 'technology' subtree with GOOGL.

Alternate ???work??? and ???play??? for maximum results

So, it is now time to talk about how to actually set up a work framework. What I would like to suggest is allocating specific time periods that would be earmarked as ???work??? and time periods that would be assigned as ???break??? or even better ???play???.

For example, you would dedicate 45 minutes of continuous, focused work on a specific task and then, follow that up with a 15 minutes break where you can surf the internet, check your social media updates, read the latest Java Code Geeks articles etc. Make sure to move your eyes away from the screen during the break and definitely getting some mild physical action. Seriously, sitting can kill you, stand up and walk.

The concept is that, among other things, the ???play??? time period would serve as a reward to yourself for having the discipline to plow through the longer time period of working. Our minds are mysterious things but I can assure you that setting up a reward mechanism like this will help you accomplish more stuff and have some fun time as well.

=== ===
Jot everything down

What I refer to here is making the habit of noting everything down. Whether it is a new idea you have, a new approach you would like to follow for a problem you are trying to solve or a bill you have to pay tomorrow. You have to make sure that your brain???s capacity is not consumed by ???remembering stuff??? but on focusing on the specific goal you are trying to accomplish.

Think of your brain as a computer CPU. The ???stuff??? you assign to it is similar to launching several process in the background. It will eventually cause it to hang and not work properly. The process of jotting things down will offload your brain and allow it to perform in a more optimal way.

Make separate lists and categorize those thoughts you have. Lists could include ???Potential Projects???, ???Thing to buy???, ???Development??? etc., so that you can quickly scan through them later on.

Doctor of Philosophy

In the context of academic degrees, the term philosophy does not refer solely to the field of philosophy, but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original Greek meaning, which is "love of wisdom".

e.g. when you notice a song is missing from your m3u playlist at work, you can modify your m3u playlist there and then rather than waiting until you get home.

Apple iPhone playlists do not allow you this instantaneous closing of a loop

Purge - disproportionate/non-linear/exponential benefit

diseconomies of scale

when you have 30 emails most of which are useless, you don't notice emails that are legitimate but can be marked as read.

If you can eliminate the useless emails, you can easily see the legitimate ones that you can mark read

Kitchen sinks also suffer from snowball of junk that becomes harder to clean

Productivity

Buffer storage and delayed replay are necessary whenever you aren't going to remember something on the day it's needed

e.g. Livescore phone app push notifications have made it much easier to remember that the UEFA Super Cup final is about to start on an obscure Tuesday morning.

Implicit reminders (e.g. open browser tab for drive in theater) vs explicit reminders

Mac screenshots of 3D models next to old photos (e.g. of where the Metropolitano used to be) are almost as useful as loading the 3D model (which requires a plugin etc)

=== ===
A system is a pre-defined sequence of steps to get a repetitively occurring task done. The better the system, the more efficiently the task is performed. You should try to install and improve systems in your workflow wherever you can.

A basic example: I just assigned an MS Word short-cut key to the action of accepting changes that my editor makes to my blog posts. That’s a simple thing to do, but it enables me to go through the corrections at least 25% faster.

Think of similar opportunities:

Assign short keys and macros on your computer.
Have your emails auto-sorted into appropriate folders.
Install software that automatically backs up your data at specified intervals.
Use a system of categorized storage boxes to keep your apartment in order.
Set up standing orders to pay your bills.
Place a “No Advertisements” sign on your mailbox so that you’ll have less paper to throw away.
Write a FAQ document for your customers, or improve the one you already have, to reduce the number of customer service requests.
Buy a larger freezer, so you can store more food and need to go shopping less frequently.
Hang decorations on the wall instead of placing them on shelves to avoid having to dust around them.
And there’s so much more you can do! Analyze your workflows and come up with your own ideas.

convert implicit todos into explicit todos (e.g. leaving mail as unread, commented code that has no todo marker)
=== ===

examples of where pictures are worth a thousand words

thumbnails for video files instead of paths
=== ===
to avoid overfitting, ask yourself whether a category is timeless.
(e.g. "Livescore app Screenshots" folder will no longer be applicable once that app is no longer used).
=== ===

Good reasons to categorize
* To aid future retreival (so don't create a tex/ subfolder called essays/ for articles you've written - it won't be a natural place to look in future)


Bad reasons to categorize
* because a folder has too many files (gratuitous categorizing). You end up simply putting things in places that later on you forget are where to find them (e.g. /e/new. Don't let tex/ folder become this way)
* to discover related items. You won't find the initial one anymore if it's moved to an obscure category
=== ===
Don't categorize by property value when the property is mutable

Eg priority of action is mutable
File extension is immutable

a girl that is 80% as attractive as a hot girl but gives 20% of the problems is a good balance.

Importance of a clean home

It gives that same mental space that a shop or library does. You can escape your constant bombardment of routine and come up with clearer insights.

It's quite similar to google having a conference room that is a rowing boat
=== ===
buffering
debit card instead of cash. You're not blocked on purchasing until you go and draw money

=== ===
Categorization 
Some items don't neatly fall into a category but they shouldn't discourage you from helpful hierarchies

Eg interdisciplinary academic disciplines 
=== ===

sometimes it's difficult to know when something has outlived its purpose

e.g. a point and shoot digital camera. Even after mine was stolen I didn't feel it was useless anyway, but it's definitely not been taken out of the house as often as it was back in the 2000's.

=== ===
Buffering productivity 
Extra bank accounts
Problem is you get charged when workers are exhausted

=== ===

The problem with having multiple copies of something is that you can't update it later. This applies to my apps (hard links are an attempt to solve this but that introduces other issues). My Mwk file will probably remain as my master copy of my data regardless of how sophisticated a mongodb or neo4j app I create for creating relationships between snippets

=== ===
Music for the beginning of a video versus the end might be predicted in suitability based on whether the opening bars go from low notes to high notes (e.g. Sky Slacker) or high to low (e.g. Final Countdown).

If you don't believe in the psychological powers of music to make you happy, start singing Aye Aye Yippe Yippe Aye and try not to smile.

=== ===
Dave Allen (courtesy of Murali)
if an errand takes less than 2 minutes, do it then and there rather than adding it to your todo list.

I think this is a useful baseline, but the disadvantage is if it turns out you can't complete it and you don't create a todo as a result ,you end up forgetting to do it which is worse than the overhead of creating a todo and not attempting it immediately.

A better rule is "if it takes less than 2 minutes AND it's not vital that it gets completed, then do it immediately"

It's analogous to TCP vs UDP semantis. UDP can complete very quickly but there is no guarantee, whereas TCP guarantees it will get done but has an overhead.

Part of the skill of photography, beyond composition, lighting etc is knowing which pictures not to share that make viewers not scroll to see the good ones

Most people fail this skill test when they upload their entire album to facebook.

Jim Ross, iin his own words, is  a documentary freak. He'll watch any documentary on TV regardless of the subject.

Why do I mention this? Because I am too. So I can draw inspiration from him about knowing how I'll turn out if I share that interest 

=== ===

probably wouldn't have bothered to go to the website, but books are so easy just to dip into

=== ===
Multitasking
It's fine multitasking as long as only one of them requires thinking power. The other should be mechanical work only
* but what's mechanical only depends on who is doing it. Your boss may tell you you should multitask with a certain item but you find it hard because you're not used to it.


=== ===
Ordering
The order in which you process items is important. One item may take much less time if you process some other (possibly lower priority) item first.
I'm not sure if you can do things in reverse and get the same benefit. Especially if one item is urgent.

=== ===
Productivity

Keeping notepad at arms length
Serendipity
We encounter useful knowledge when we're busy doing something else

=== ===
to the idiots who say it only takes five minutes of your time they are clueless about the cost of interruptions to long-running contiguous tasks.
=== ===
Why multitasking is dangerous
e.g. you copy a multi-gigabyte build tree from a server. It stops and asks "do you want to overwrite this file?". If you're off doing something else you don't see it and that task ends up costing you time.

Just like computers themselves, key bindings help you make mistakes faster (e.g. git commits; people like Lenny and Eddie don't use them)
=== ===
Access/Reachability
If things have fatal consequences, do not make them as easily reachable (e.g. do not create an alias to "git reset --hard HEAD")
* If you use them regularly, the consequences are not so fatal almost by definition (if you execute "git reset --hard HEAD" habitually and an alias is useful, that indicates that the consequences are not fatal).
=== ===

"slow start" in automated bank transfers
analogous to changing time in a distributed system. Never let time go backwards. Adjust exponentially 

actually I'm not sure if the 2 are quite the same
gradual sync - tends towards the optimum
slow start - fluctuates about the optimum


=== ===

Touch typing has been invaluable productivity investment. I can text while driving using a bluetooth keyboard.

I almost lost my ability to touch type in the early 2000s. Then I made an effort to resurrect it even when it was difficult. Thankfully I never lost it after that.

=== ===

why trees are better than graphs
imagine trying to give users complete ownership/ control over their yurl data if you have non-standard or unnatural ways of referring to other notes that are not inline (as they are with trees)

=== ===
productivity
Inbox vs starring emails for action items
* Inbox - subtractive (gets populated, often with the wrong things, without your action. Has too much junk and makes it harder to see what action items you have)
* Starred - additive (it only gets populated by self actions)

productivity
distinguish between infinite lists and finite lists
e.g. Email folders for:
* unfinished tasks (past or future): infinite
* unfinished tasks (future - i.e. I plan to finish): finite 
Hmmmm, I can't find the right words to capture this. But basically, I don't want to continue starring emails in GMail without removing stars on things that are just not worth finishing anymore
=== ===

Marketers want you believe that you???ll ???save??? money using coupons and buying when promotional discounts are in effect. In reality, you???ll save money by not spending any. When you make a discounted purchase, you are not ???saving??? money, you are simply spending less. Splitting hairs, you say? Look at the bank account at the end of a shopping trip and you tell me. Did you spend or did you save?

earth science
geology (limestone from shells, ice age)
archaeology
political science (order in cities)

civilization studies (Persian, Roman empires)
divinity (rise of islam)

(arabic numerals originating in India, Fibonacci writes about it and teaches it to Europe. Enables global business currencies and distance measurement)
(Christopher columbus)
agriculture (worldwide crop imports)
(sugar - the only chemical source of energy for human brains)
business (industrial revolution, economic trade between empires)

How to stay motivated to learn about business after MBA
Since there is no "force" from reading assignments it's difficult to get absorbed
With computer books it's easy because every day you're using a computer and looking for enhancements

look for existing highlights in books, start reading the surrounding text. That should get your brain in motion and then you'll start looking for literature in tangential concepts.
=== ===

Most people don't use text editor apps

=== Grouping ===
==== learning-feedback-economies of scale ====
Printing all available lecture ppts instead of just the next few
* because it's impossible to configure correctly the first time you try to print: duplex, multiple pages per sheet, hole punches, staple position
* if you wait until the next week for the next class you'll probably forget and waste more of your time walking to and from the printer, unlocking your screen

=== grouping ===
==== why grouping works ====
it reduces the number of items in your inventory so you know what you have with less counting
=== how each academic discipline views humans ===
artist - a beautifully drawn sketch of aesthetically pleasing lines shapes
biologist - an evolutionary success story
dancer - a form of expression through movement of an animate being
chemist - a perfect balance of chemical processes
computer scientist - an graph database algorithm that is so sophisticated we have yet to understand and emulate it
businessman - more humans means more revenue

=== how to read a book original tip ===
the earlier statements are more important than later sentences (because you read things forward, never backwards. Later sentences assume previous knowledge and are generally elaborations)
If overwhelmed, just read the beginning parts of a section, paragraph etc. or it's like trying to climb a rope that isn't tied/anchored to anything. You end up going nowhere and the rope just falls through your hands and wasting your time

implications: 
* read the opening sentences of a section, and possibly paragraph, more slowly and 
* don't "skip" words that don't leap off the page at you. They may dramatically improve your understanding of what follows. Once you get further into a block of text (paragraph, section etc) you can afford to miss things without missing anything fundamental 
** It's like a breadth first traversal of a tree. If you miss the root node you are in deep trouble. If you miss a node in level 7 it's almost inconsequential
** It's also similar to corrupt files or arrays that state a length (not null terminated ones). If you miss the critical header information then it can affect your ability to understand what follows.
* don't allow your mind to wander and mentally multitask, at least not in opening sentences. If you feel the urge, stop and wait until you have attended to the other thought

There are 2 techniques for studying for an exam
# "Static analysis" - re-reading your notes, and copying whatever you believe is important
# "Dynamic analysis" - doing practive problems, and noting whatever you believe is important

I believe 2) is more important than 1), but if 2) just needs to be done once to load the volatile lessons into short-term memory (which lasts about a week), and static analysis is sufficient in the 24 hours leading up to the exam but is only effective if dynamic analysis has been done in the preceding 7 days.

Imagine every possible roadblock to getting online. This has it.

I don't usually write reviews for the sake of helping people but I was so furious that it was the only way to keep myself calm and not yell at my family walking in and out of my room.

1. SIM card size: it's difficult to tell which size SIM card to burst out of the container plastic. (solution - you want the bigger one)
2. SIM card insert: Even if you have the right one, it takes a while to figure out where to insert it (solution - do not put it in the metal bracket)
3. Wireless key: not obvious what it is, had to browse the web on my slower wifi hotspot to get the answer (solution - it's the last 8 digits of an IMEI code printed on the bottom of your box, NOT on the SIM plastic like the web claims)
4. Activation page: didn't load in Chrome on my Mac. Eventually I realized that it worked in Safari or on my iPhone.
5. After entering your details to get activated, there's a tiny link to confirm that is easy to miss so I had to redo the activation.
6. Just when you think you're finally set up, it says Facebook is 18+ and you need to register to access the extra controls to unblock it.
7. The Registration page is just coming back to the same  page even though I've entered all data seemingly correctly, and it erases non-secure input and makes you retype each time. (Solution - after entering your postcode, be sure to press "lookup address")
8. After eventually figuring out why the form wasn't submitting correctly, it asks for an activation pin (4 numbers, not that it tells you that) that is sent to your phone. Ummmm, I don't have a phone! The phone number I entered was for the wifi device. And it won't let me request a new one more than once, so I'm screwed even if I find the original pin somehwere. (solution - it sends the message to your router admin at 192.168.1.1, login with admin/admin)
9. It only accepts a UK credit card to unlock 18+ websites, so coming from the US this is no use. It also says in the same resulting screen that it succeeded, failed and required restart. Seriously I'm not joking. (Solution - it's failed, you can't use this approach if you don't have a UK credit card)

I've been trying for more than an hour since opening the shrink-wrap, and have missed a football match I was hoping to catch the 2nd half of. Thanks for nothing.

The one positive thing I can say is that it's a lot faster than my existing Three wifi.

Very good, but HUGE

Here are my observations in order of discovery in the 24 hours I've had it:

Good: Preassembled (welded actually) except for the wheels so no delayed gratification of Ikea product assembly required. The wheels can relatively easily be pushed in (though a rubber mallet would be handy). Pulling them out is easier than putting them in surprisingly.

Bad: Too big to fit in the trunk or back seat of my' Toyota Corolla that I'd planned on taking it home in (it was shipped to my workplace, I don't know if I would have had to sign for a home delivery for which no one would have been home). I ended up renting a U-Haul van which set me back an extra $75 on top of a high shipping cost, in addition to disrupting my work day. Note: if you have a choice between 1) low product price + high shipping cost or 2) high product price + low shipping cost, it's probably better to go for the latter in case the company act funny about which portions they're willing to refund (not that I know, I'm not returning it).

Good: Surprisingly light so pushing this around is not something to worry about (the large wheels also make superman force to push unnecessary even with lots of books on it). With a bit of inconvenience I was able to lift this up a flight of stairs when bringing it home. The size more than the weight is the inconvenience here. I wish there was some sort of ramp to wheel the item up.

Bad: A bit too big for my bedroom. I wanted something to put by my bedside so that I could keep my bedside reading material neat and clearable rather than having stacks of books on the floor. Walking around it to reach other areas of my bedroom (e.g. the window, mirror, floor lamp or existing bookshelf) is not as straightforward as you may think. Plus it's a bit high so it blocks out a bit of light from my window to my bed.

Good: It is HUGE (the photo is deceptive, a wheel is about the size of a DVD in diameter). A lot of my older books that I had put in my storage room because my bookshelf was full are now suddenly visible again right by my bedside. Unfortunately this makes it an excuse for me not to be so ruthless about donating as many of my 400 books even if I haven't opened them in years. I'd guess that the 6 shelves collectively hold 150-200 books (though note being 2 sided means you can only see half of them at a time).

I'm happy I bought this. I expect it will be worth the money over a lifetime. Just think twice whether you really need one this big if it's for a home. In fact, get your measuring tape out.
== Programming Tips ==

===  ===
code modifying (to implement new features) is easier to get working when you have something that works beforehand.

===  ===
executables rot, libraries do not
So try and make your personal apps into a (collection of) libraries
===  ===
The extension class loader (also known as the standard extensions class loader) is a child of the
bootstrap class loader. Its primary responsibility is to load classes from the extension directories,
normally located the jre/lib/ext directory. This provides the ability to simply drop in new extensions,
such as various security extensions, without requiring modification to the user's classpath.
===  ===

To implement the Java Virtual Machine correctly, you need only be able to read the class file format and correctly perform the operations specified therein. Implementation details that are not part of the Java Virtual Machine's specification would unnecessarily constrain the creativity of implementors. For example, the memory layout of run-time data areas, the garbage-collection algorithm used, and any internal optimization of the Java Virtual Machine instructions (for example, translating them into machine code) are left to the discretion of the implementor.
===  ===
One of the gripes why people dislike Java as a desktop application is probably because of the additional requisite of having the presence of the JVM, which is generally either not bundled with any of the major operating systems in the market today, or that it can be the wrong version of the JVM that is needed. This makes it really annoying for end users if they just wanted something that 'works out of the box'.

I got interested with the idea that, what if your application can create a seamless experience, as if it's like a binary application running on the native platform, by having the JVM embedded in as part of the package, so that most of the core application besides the loader can be written in Java?

===  ===
for example in Windows, 'java' will be 'java.exe', and for libraries like libjvm.so' will be corresponding to 'jvm.dll' instead.

(libjvm.dylib on mac)
===  ===
declarative programs can be more verbose because there is no context that holds some of the information
===  ===
when to use separate processes rather than threads

when processes are unstable or liable to produce memory leaks (e.g. my yurl server keeps crashing and I'm not sure why - maybe the headless browsers. I know it's not the youtube downloader because I'm currently using the shell script and that is a separate process)
or when memory intensive processes don't get allocated the memory they need.
===  ===
too soon to automate
similar to rapid prototyping

can start by creating an app with static content (i.e. just HTML). This is surprisingly sufficient for some use cases.
===  ===
bullshit software

prefer templates over dynamic content generation if the generated content is immutable
(this is true both in content bases, but also code generation tools)
===  ===

Proactive vs reactive programming
* Proactive - "I need to move this class to this module, and I know that means I need to edit packages x y and z"
* Reactive - Change 1 thing and keep fixing failed test (or, for college students, compile errors)
** you assume that if the test passes, there's nothing more to be done
** You often miss important things that the compiler, runtime or unit tests doesn't alert you to change.

===  ===

debugging

common causes of bugs

inconsistent data when duplicated
===  ===
In Unix the collection is a text file whose items are the lines in the file. Each line contains various values, separated by whitespace. The meaning of each value is given by its ordering in the line. The operations are unix processes and collections are composed using the pipeline operator with the standard output of one process piped to the standard input of the next.

In an object-oriented program the collections are a collection class (list, array, set, etc). The items in the collection are the objects within the collection, these objects may be collections themselves or contain more collections. The operations are the various methods defined on the collection class itself - usually on some high level superclass. The operations are composed through a method chain.

===  ===

higher order functions make code compact because they hide the repetitive code
===  ===

debugging/code reading
it's a lot easier to understand code when you have access to runtime values of variables.
===  ===

in theory hiding remote communication from your application makes programming simpler (such as with GWT)

in practice you end up writing code in a suboptimal location, and it's not even clear whether a certain module is intended for the client or server (yes you have packages, but what about common code?)

===  ===
Computer analogies
These steps are called authentication and authorization, respectively. Here’s a real- world example: a flight attendant checks your photo identification (authentication) and your ticket (authorization) before permitting you to board an airplane.
===  ===
copy paste (static linking) is better than refactoring long term because you don't have to worry about unintended effects
===  ===
when modularity is counter productive

adding unit tests as a prerequisite to an app getting built and released (as opposed to some sanity checks in the main method)
===  ===

Sequence diagram - who CALLS who
Class diagram - who STORES who

I THINK that who CALLS is more important in understanding an application

===  ===

System vs application

I THINK a system is something that is only called through writing code (though scripting blurs the line)

===  ===

An interactive shell is half way between a user interface and an API for calling code

As you can imagine hidden dependencies can be bad. They are hard to detect for developers using the classes with the hidden dependencies. They can only see them by inspecting the code.

"unnecessarily extensive dependency" on the HttpServletRequest interface. It depends on more than it needs to carry out its work. 

Context dependencies are bad because it makes the general purpose component unusable outside of the application too.

it is better for a component to depend on a class or interface from the standard Java (or C# etc.) packages. These classes and interfaces are always available to anyone, making it easier to satisfy these component dependencies. In addition the these classes are less likely to change and cause your application to fail compilation.

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/ood/understanding-dependencies.html
=== ===
The more methods an interface has, the less chance there is that developers will provide their own implementation for that interface, unless they are required to. Therefore, the more methods an interface has the larger the probability is that developers will just stick to the default implementation of that interface. In other words, the larger and more complex an interface becomes, the tighter it is coupled to its default implementation!

Monolith first
Microservices are a useful architecture, but even their advocates say that using them incurs a significant MicroservicePremium, which means they are only useful with more complex systems. This premium, essentially the cost of managing a suite of services, will slow down a team, favoring a monolith for simpler applications. 

As we're now recognizing, often the best way to find out if a software idea is useful is to build a simplistic version of it and see how well it works out.  During this first phase you need to prioritize speed (and thus cycle time for feedback), so the premium of microservices is a drag you should do without.

The second issue with starting with microservices is that they only work well if you come up with good, stable boundaries between the services - which is essentially the task of drawing up the right set of BoundedContexts. Any refactoring of functionality between services is much harder than it is in a monolith. But even experienced architects working in familiar domains have great difficulty getting boundaries right at the beginning. By building a monolith first, you can figure out what the right boundaries are, before a microservices design brushes a layer of treacle over them.

I've heard different ways to execute a monolith-first strategy. The logical way is to design a monolith carefully, paying attention to modularity within the software, both at the API boundaries and how the data is stored. Do this well, and it's a relatively simple matter to make the shift to microservices. However I'd feel much more comfortable with this approach if I'd heard a decent number of stories where it worked out that way.

A more common approach is to start with a monolith and gradually peel off microservices at the edges. Such an approach can leave a substantial monolith at the heart of the microservices architecture, but with most new development occurring in the microservices while the monolith is relatively quiescent.

	this was so true of objectivity DB

Another common approach is to just replace the monolith entirely. Few people look at this as an approach to be proud of, yet there are advantages to building a monolith as a SacrificialArchitecture. Don't be afraid of building a monolith that you will discard, particularly if a monolith can get you to market quickly.

Another route I've run into is to start with just a couple of coarse-grained services, larger than those you expect to end up with. Use these coarse-grained services to get used to working with multiple services, while enjoying the fact that such coarse granularity reduces the amount of inter-service refactoring you have to do. Then as boundaries stabilize, break down into finer-grained services. [2]

As mobile devices came to the market Flash wasn't supported on them due to the fact that Flash was an application that needed to be installed. Phones don't typical have program installs and phone manufactuers didn't want to pre-install Flash on their devices. Famously Apple refused to put Flash on their iPhone and that was a major turning point towards the usage of CSS, Javascript and HTML 5.

It turns out, you can build a successful company on top of a giant pile of spaghetti code. In fact, I think this is probably the norm. And railing against hard to read code will result in less friends for you and the code will likely remain the same. 

I guess what I’m saying is, clean, maintainable, semantic code is really for the benefit of other developers. ‘Do unto others” and all that. So go forth and build websites, and by all means make the HTML semantic and the CSS modular and beautiful, but remember it’s not for you. It’s not for some obsessive, compulsive desire to get everything perfect and check all the boxes. The extra effort is for your future maintainers. It’s for your friends and colleagues.

I don't think I agree with this:

One of the assumed benefit of a framework is that it can be ported to a different platform with less issues. But in practice porting an application from one platform to another seems like such an unlikely situation that I wouldn't want to incur the headaches it brings.

A library is simply a collection of methods/functions wrapped up into a package that can be imported into a code project and re-used.

A framework is a robust library or collection of libraries that provides a "foundation" for your code. A framework follows the Inversion of Control pattern.

SDK: "Software Development Kit"

An SDK is a collection of tools to assist the programmer to create and deploy code/content which is very specifically targetted to either run on a very particular platform or in a very particular manner. An SDK can consist of simply a set of libraries which must be used in a specific way only by the client code and which can be compiled as normal, up to a set of binary tools which create or adapt binary assets to produce it's (the SDK's) output.

Historically, a toolkit is a more focussed library, with a defined and specific purpose. Currently, this term has fallen out of favour, and is used almost exclusively (to this author's knowledge) for graphical widgets, and GUI components in the current era. A toolkit will most often operate at a higher layer of abstraction than a library, and will often consume and use libraries itself.

http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance

What is the fastest way of (not) logging?
SLF4J supports an advanced feature called parameterized logging which can significantly boost logging performance for disabled logging statement.
For some Logger logger, writing,
logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that is converting both integer i and entry[i] to a String, and concatenating intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether the message will be logged or not.
One possible way to avoid the cost of parameter construction is by surrounding the log statement with a test. Here is an example.
if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
  logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
}
This way you will not incur the cost of parameter construction if debugging is disabled for logger. On the other hand, if the logger is enabled for the DEBUG level, you will incur the cost of evaluating whether the logger is enabled or not, twice: once in debugEnabled and once in debug. This is an insignificant overhead because evaluating a logger takes less than 1% of the time it takes to actually log a statement.
Better yet, use parameterized messages
There exists a very convenient alternative based on message formats. Assuming entry is an object, you can write:
Object entry = new SomeObject();
logger.debug("The entry is {}.", entry);
After evaluating whether to log or not, and only if the decision is affirmative, will the logger implementation format the message and replace the '{}' pair with the string value of entry. In other words, this form does not incur the cost of parameter construction in case the log statement is disabled.

=== ===
MVC is bad because you have multiple entry points to packages (unless you pass complex data structures between layers)
=== ===
Unit testing is more important in code that is likely to regress. There's no point in testing code that will not break once initially written.

In other words, only code that gets changed is likely to break and benefit from testing.
=== ===
Stateless apps are also easier to gradually phase out

=== ===
logging

INFO - for data flow
DEBUG - for control flow
=== ===
When making significant code changes, doing unit testing as you go is an unwelcome interruption. You haven't yet figured out fully what you're doing (unless you are an archaic believer in the phase gate model - i.e. code the whole thing in your head first, and if you discover anything unexpected later you get blamed).

=== ===
shortest possible code is not the same thing as most readable code (e.g. people's attempts to refactor JUnit tests, using custom data arrays)

This is the kind of premature optimization that rarely matters much. I'd choose a data structure and get on with it. Once you have a complete system that has a problem, profile it to find out where the issue is. Your chances of guessing and hitting the poor performance nail on the head are small indeed.

A system that's fast but doesn't work is worthless. A slow system that works is useful to some people and will become useful to more as it gets faster.

Also remember that an unoptimized but appropriate algorithm will beat a super-optimized poor algorithm nearly every time.

Mock up a prototype and use a profiler on it before you even begin to think about micro-optimization perf.

We learn rules, syntax etc from examples, not by being told the rules. For example, when learning DynamoDB, this is how I learnt the syntax for bind variables:

	UpdateItemResult outcome = dynamoDBClient.updateItem(new UpdateItemRequest()
					.withTableName(SERIAL)
					.withKey(ImmutableMap.of("FOO", new AttributeValue("BAR")))
					.withUpdateExpression("set #p = #p + :val")
					.withExpressionAttributeNames(ImmutableMap.of("#p", "PageCount"))
					.withExpressionAttributeValues(ImmutableMap.of(":val", new AttributeValue().withN("1"))));

Excellent idea to use familiar OO code snippets to introduce functional concepts to OO programmers.

It's much easier to start from something we already know, generalise the concept, and give it a label, than it is to start from a label which we don't recognise, describe the concept (which forces us to begin by understanding the abstract, general case), and only then give examples.

An actor is a container for State, Behavior, a Mailbox, Children and a Supervisor Strategy. All of this is encapsulated
behind an Actor Reference

Treat Actors like People. People who don't talk to each other in person. They just talk through mails.
* A student sends a mail to a teacher, a mail that cannot be changed once sent.
* The teacher will check her mailbox finding the mail at a time she sees fit.
* The teacher sends a mail back to the student at some later time, also immutable once sent.
* The student later on decides to checks his mailbox and then finds the mail, (he has not been standing by the mailbox waiting for an answer).


Similarly to how you can send javascript code to the client's machine to do some of your application's processing rather than load your own machine in basic web applications, you create a separate thread of execution for another CPU (or CPU core) in an actor that gets created and destroyed and continue doing other useful work on yours. But the framework ensures you only pass immutable messages between machines so you can't get race conditions.

Languages that support higher language functions can often solve simple dependency inversion problems by passing behaviour as a function instead of an object which implements an interface in the OO-sense.

In such languages, the function's signature can become the interface and a function is passed in instead of a traditional object to provide the desired behaviour. The hole in the middle pattern is a good example for this.

you don't need to implement a whole class that conforms to an (OOP) interface to provide the desired behaviour for the caller. Instead, you can just pass a simple function definition

=== ===
In a functional language like F# we can do the same thing without the overhead of having to declare classes and interfaces.

In a traditional thread-based system, when you get to the receptionist you stand at the counter for as long as it takes you to complete your transaction. If you have to fill out 3 forms, you would do so right there at the counter while the receptionist just sits there waiting for you. You are blocking her or him from servicing any other customers.

The only real way to scale a thread-based system is to add more receptionists. This, however, has financial implications in that you have to pay more people and physical implications in that you have to make the room for the additional receptionist windows.

Events To The Rescue

In an event-based system, when you get to the window and find out you had to complete additional forms, the receptionist gives you the forms, a clipboard and a pen and tells you to come back when you have completed the forms. You go sit down in the waiting and the receptionist helps the next person in line. You are not blocking her from servicing others.

When you are done with your forms, you get back in line and wait to speak with the receptionist again. If you have done something incorrectly or need to fill out another form, he or she will give you the new form or tell you the correction and you’ll repeat the process of going off, doing your work, and then waiting in line again.

This system is already highly scalable (and is in fact used in most doctor’s offices I visit). If the waiting line starts getting too long, you can certainly add an additional receptionist, but you don’t need to do so at quite the rate of a thread-based system.

The Fast Food Restaurant Analogy

It struck me that this is also very similar to ordering your food at a fast-food restaurant or street vendor.

The thread-based way would be to get to the front of the line, give your order to the cashier and then wait right there until your order was cooked and given to you. The cashier would not be able to help the next person until you got your food and went on your way. Need to service more customers… just add more cashiers!

Pattern matching vs imperative cases
One real situation we face this problem in is email filters. A message matches multiple filters with conflicting actions. We try and solve this problem by placing one filter at a higher precedence than the other. This introduces a time component which makes it imperative. Whether this is a bad thing or not in the field of message filtering is a matter of opinion.
Outlook takes the approach of only applying a filter if none of the other filters match the message. This is helpful in simple cases, but when you have too many rules it becomes harder to find the rule that is preventing your new one from getting applied.

It's harder to reason about imperative code because you can't compose functions. Composition makes it easy to summarize what large blocks of code do.

data flow vs control flow

furniture  component assembly vs all activities performed by the user (including opening the box, reading instructions, going for a coffee break)

You may eventually need to know WHY the human assembled the furniture as he did by debugging his tangential activities (control flow), but not before you know WHAT he assembled (data flow).

Can you afford to just focus on data flow initially? In my opinion yes because control flow revolves around data flow the same way leaves revolve around tree branches. You won't end up ignoring important things because if they are important they'll have some impact on the data you care about (user data as opposed to control data).

Gradual vs sudden changes

Gradual is usually better, because human uptake is gradual. It's also harder to go back on a small change than a big one.

* Deprecate methods, don't delete them
* C++ prefix style for methods so you can put multiple classes, the way C developers are used to.

=== ===

Why C++ has class prefixes for method names.

It's basically a holdover from C. If you forced people to keep unrelated methods in separate files they just wouldn't use C++ and would stick to C.
As with so many things - it's better to gradually change rather than sudden.

anonymous braces slow technical debt from growing as quickly, I would guess. Because it makes refactoring easier.

Code writing/Debugging

Code writing
More abstractions means less coupled code, but usually harder to use and understand. Only experience and knowing your target audience can make you choose the optimal abstraction level.

What I would suggest is to design the program with little or no abstraction. Just use the simplest thing that works. At some point you'll realize that "Hey, this would be a lot simpler if I introduced an abstraction here." When that happens, then you can put in an abstraction of some kind. 

code is delegating too much of of its work to other sections of code
 might not even be in the same source code file.

1 good example of unnecessary abstractation is database (or persistence) abstractation. 95% or all java appliactions that are using a database, uses a relational (SQL) database. But still, EJB and JDO tries to be independent of database type. To be able to achieve this, they have to re-invent SQL in form of EJB-QL and JDO-QL. This is a over-abstractation. 

Abstraction is a way of hiding complexity at the expense of introducing new complexity


=== ===
Code writing
one of the reasons that I favor the pure Ajax/REST web architecture I described earlier is because it???s easy to mentally separate into three parts (browser, wire, server) and it???s easy to understand how these parts interact (HTTP requests from browser to server via wire; HTTP responses from server to browser via wire). Why is this ability to compartmentalize subsystems desirable? Because it???s easy to debug when something inevitably goes wrong.

you can't drive as fast when it's raining, even though your car has windshield wipers and headlights and a roof and a heater, all of which protect you from caring about the fact that it's raining (they abstract away the weather), but lo, you have to worry about hydroplaning (or aquaplaning in England) and sometimes the rain is so strong you can't see very far ahead so you go slower in the rain, because the weather can never be completely abstracted away, because of the law of leaky abstractions.

Code writing

opposite of hard coding

The reason we find ourselves Soft Coding is because we fear change. Not the normal Fear of Change, but the fear that the code we write will have to be changed as a result of a business rule change.

It???s a pretty silly fear to have. The whole point of software (hence, the ???soft???) is that it can change that it will change. The only way to insulate your software from business rule changes is to build a completely generic program that???s devoid of all business rules yet can implement any rule. Oh, and they???ve already built that tool. It???s called C++. And Java. And C#. And Basic. And, dare I say, COBOL.

=== ===
Code writing

you shouldn???t write code before you actually need it
you???re going to have to redesign it for your real needs once you actually start using it.
trying to write reusable code before reuse is pointless. Even if you make it reusable for future cases you imagine, you end up reusing it in a different future case. In which case your code is still just as messy as if you didn't think of the future at all.
Instead, write MINIMAL code (actually, more than minimal - SIMPLE code). So when new cases come along later there is less existing code to understand and change.

Jetty has a slogan, "Don't deploy your application in Jetty, deploy Jetty in your application."

Put another way, running Jetty in embedded mode means putting an HTTP module into your application, rather than putting your application into an HTTP server.

Test driven development is unrealistic in cases similar to exposing java bindings for a C++ library

you (may?) have to look at the header to determine whether a method is static or not

C++ methods must have the class name in front of them for somewhat historical reasons. C developers would put unrelated modules in the same class. To ensure adoption of C++ by C developers, C++ allowed you to put your methods in any physical file.

reasoning about programs with state

It's easier with C than OO because you know what the top level state object is and have some intuition about how to visually model it. Eg qbcdef

In java it's not so obvious because even though you have "this" and each referencec type parameter:
1) The relationships between each of those state objects is not clear (is one the source and the other the destination)
2) OO objects are designed to be abstract so their internals aren't easily accessible. Instead you have to rely on names to make sense of them conceptually. But a lot of the time the same words have different meanings in different applications (e.g. Context, Manager, Resource, Session ). 
* Solution: at least have a dictionary of terms you can understand: transaction, task, node,  AND learn the domain specific objects (via an object dependency graph)

3) important state objects may be accessible non obviously

Type safety using XML (instead of json) and a special compiler or compiler extensions in theory (and executives minds) improves productivity because it catches developer mistakes at compile time with the presumption that it's easier to debug than runtime bugs. In practice, all the formal correctness that such compiler extensions insist on is redundant conceptually and slows the developer down, preventing them from dedicating their attention to formulating solutions to the business problem
=== ===
call graphs and object dependency graphs are sufficient for learning non-object-oriented code.

For object oriented code, use sequence diagrams (I learnt this thanks to that period at Objectivity when I apparently wasn't doing enough work).

Also for OO code, learn the data structures (like Torvalds said). But this s not substantiated by my own experience yet.







=== ===
Forget pojos. Just use JSON. It's a much looser dependency (it's serialization ouput is unambiguous unlike serialization of a java object)

Also there's one less layer of code to maintain. That's huge. And fixing broken pojo to orm  mappings cannot be done with a real-time compiler the way you can with a plain java compiler.

Functions that operate on a stream, producing another stream, are known as filters, and can be connected in pipelines, analogously to function composition. 

Filters may operate on one item of a stream at a time, or may base an item of output on multiple items of input, such as a moving average.

Xargs is like this


In object-oriented programming, input streams are generally implemented as iterators.

For prototyping use dynamically typed language like nodejs. Strictly speaking groovy is too, but somehow I still feel javascript is more forgiving when you just want something to work with minimal effort. Perl is good too but it's another language you have to learn whereas javascript you already have to know for client side. Same with python

I'm going to side with Paul Graham on this one: dynamic typing is most useful for creating programs organically, which is exactly what prototyping ought to be. The point is to get something done quickly that demonstrates the functionality of the final product, not the final product itself. Static typing is about formal correctness

Prototyping in natural language

A third type of language to consider: natural language. Instead of prototyping in code, one can prototype in writing. The customer can then read your documentation and critique your design early on, but cannot toy around with a working demo. If well-written, the documentation can make implementation in any language straightforward.

scratch refactoring is a great way to learn code but is difficult if:

* the code isn't functional style
* the IDE doesn't support refactoring (e.g. Eclipse javascript refactoring simply isn't possible)

frameworks are awful because you have no idea what the control flow is. You have a bunch of methods and it's not obvious by looking at the syntax which method is called first. Furthermore it's not obvious why a certain method must be implemented.

The Pipe-and-Filter style emphasizes the incremental transformation of data by successive components. This is a typical style in the UNIX family of operating systems. 

Filters are stream transducers. They incrementally transform data (stream to stream), use little contextual information, and retain no state information between instantiations. Pipes are stateless and simply exist to move data between filters.

in theory learning an app architecture can be done via its packages. In practice, it's messy because sibling packages refer to each other. It's not a directed acyclic tree so not everything can be "drilled down"

in production, all you have are log files
worse still, you only have INFO or above logging (unless your system is sophisticated)
WRONG: At Google, all log levels are available. 
With WebObjects, you can change the log  level at runtime which is extremely useful.

Look for stack traces in the log files. 

If there is more than one instance of the app

You should be able to randomly select a host and look at its log file. If it only occurs on certain hosts, it is not a problem with the binaries (this is obvious but easy to forget).
Check if the command line arguments for launching the binary are the same in the failing host as the host where you don't see the error.
If they are the same, it must be related to the host itself rather than our binary or its invocation.
If the configuration is not the issue, restarting the process is enough to stop the error (temporarily).
It may be a host issue that is CAUSED by the binary - e.g. excessive memory usage - which other instances on other hosts haven't yet reached.

dataflow analysis

=== ===
This book offers data flow as a simple and powerful metaphor for programming. The idea is this: look at a program as a black box that takes information in and spews information out, then at each stage refine this black box by breaking it out into individual ones. I read this book many years ago and it remains the most useful book on program design that I have read. It was written before object oriented programming but it adapts to it in an obvious way. Forget about UML. Data flow is the best way of presenting the elusive big picture view, that view of the forest that gets obscured by all those trees. It has the following virtues offered nowhere else: 1. It serves as a design tool that you can work with and refine to identify object classes. 2. It is easily understood by computer illiterate clients. 3. It allows programmers new to a project to quickly come up to speed.

==== ====
don't even consider microservices unless you have a system that's too complex to manage as a monolith. The majority of software systems should be built as a single monolithic application. Do pay attention to good modularity within that monolith, but don't try to separate it into separate services.
==== ====

It's okay to write code in a way that makes testing easier. That's what dependency injection is afterall.

People may say don't test inside production code but again, that's only assuming a perfect world where features are not regularly getting added and tiny performance improvements are significant (which usually they aren't).

=== OO higher level logical data flow / call graph is split into creational and behavioral halves ===

data flow in Object oriented systems is easier once you realize that it's a call graph of broken subcalls. A calls B, and B calls C but the latter only happens later. In between, B might store what A passes to it before passing it on to C. (does this mean it is temporally coupled?)

A -> B
	B gets instantiated with "new" along with some input data (constructor args)

B -> C
	B's method gets called (perhaps with further input params), instantiating C etc.

Embedded vs standalone server

Spring
Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional WAR file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java main() method. Along the way, you use Spring’s support for embedding the Tomcat servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.
===  ===
Spring

The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there wasn’t a single line of XML? No web.xml file either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you didn’t have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

If you can write good code slowly, or mediocre code quickly, you are an average developer.


Features that aren't going to change the world don't need to be powered by code written like the feature was the most critical component of the system.

Since most features of your average application are of average importance, you should expect to see, on average, code of average quality.



I invite you to look through the source of a popular project in your language of choice

You'll find some code that even you, as just an intermediate developer, could improve by at least a tiny amount.

After exploring the source, would you find the project less useful? Absolutely not! But you will now understand that source code is, on average, written by average people.

If your average code empowers users with working features in an acceptable amount of time, you're doing great!
====   ====
Perfectionism is kind of like a dog’s predatory instinct. When curbed and restrained, it’s really useful–

as a lot of it can be about fear of failure and correction and about protecting self-worth–that’s why people tend to focus on perfecting what they do well rather than risking something new

First, implement a new capability in the simplest [SimplestOrEasiest?] way you can think of that "could possibly work". Don't build a lot of amazing superstructure, don't do anything fancy, just put it in. Use an if statement, even. Make the code pass the UnitTests for the new feature (and all features, as always).

Second, and this is critical to the rule, refactor the system to be the simplest possible code including all the features it now has.

Simplest does, however, mean a minimal solution. Don't build a giant super-efficient object, sorted and hashed and linked together, if an Array will do the job.

What it does mean, however, is to pick something you can do and do quickly, so that you can get on with the other things you really need to do. Then do that thing professionally and well, complete with all appropriate refactoring.

One little step at a time, lest I be presumptuous, lest I hurt myself, lest I hurt others. 

DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork entails two (2) steps: first, implement the thing in a simple straightforward way; second, refactor the code to produce the simplest system including the new thing.

er, you might not think to simplify the requirements - most people don't explore the dimensions of negotiation in them

consider all solutions to your task that could possibly work. Implement the simplest solution. Refactor from there if and when needed. 

A programming practice in which mopping up after the occasionnal misfire is considered cheaper than overthinking everything upfront. See also DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork, RidiculousSimplicityGivesRidiculousResources.

 a monolithic system that takes a long time to finish, and that delivering only a certain portion of the functionality, early, will gain wider acceptance for your system.

 Heavily-engineered tools simply can't economically compete with the more nimble and somewhat hacked-together tools. Customers keep preferring quantity of features and cheap features over reliability and technical polish. I'm not necessarily endorsing one or the other, only saying it's a reality of the marketplace. (Apple is perhaps an exception, but sex-appeal may play a bigger role than productivity for Apple customers.)

From the customer's perspective, the lack of features is a bigger "quality" problem

"economics over science", not "engineering". Given a choice, many if not most engineers are perfectionist by nature and would prefer to have the time to get every detail right. But, the marketplace puts as much pressure on features, schedule, and price as it does on quality

Plan to build something as quickly as possible and modify it as needed in the future.

====   ====
Mental Masturbation

Pleasurable but unproductive mental activity; at least in the short-term.
Sometimes people use a tool, language, or technique because it has ideas that stimulate or entertain their mind.
====   ====
There's always some lazy bozo who is happy to waste 10 minutes of your time in preference to spending 10 seconds of his own time.

It may be like people spending 70 hours to fix their own car in their driveway rather than just pay a mechanic $250.
====   ====
First implement the simplest solution. Then refactor to make the solution clear and adhere to OnceAndOnlyOnce.

"do the thing that will work in the fewest, tiniest steps".

Do the easiest thing that could possibly work, and then pound it into the simplest thing that could possibly work.

Look, just get it done and working; and worry about making it pretty and witty and wise afterwards.

Simplest though is more refactorable and elegant, whereas simplest is not always easily changed. Easiest means you are deferring the need for refactoring later.

When using a framework, the framework is in charge of running the system. It defines some extensibility points (interfaces) where you need to put your implementation.

When using a library, you are in charge of running the system. The library defines some points through which you can access it (functions and types) and your code can call it as it needs.

The difference between libraries and frameworks is pretty much the same as the difference between calling a function and having to provide a function as an argument:

Frameworks shape how you code

The next problem with frameworks is that they control the structure of your code. The typical example of this is when you are using a framework that requires you to inherit from some abstract base class and implement specific methods.

In Initialize, you are supposed to load any resources that your game might need; Update is called repeatedly to calculate the next state and Draw is called when the screen needs to be updated. The interface is pretty much designed to an imperative programming model, 

does the framework guaratnee that Initialize will be called before Draw? Well, how are we supposed to know that?

To end on a lighter note, you can find frameworks not just in software, but also in ordinary life. If you buy package holidays, you're buying a framework - they transport you to some place, put you in a hotel, feed you and your activities have to fit into the shape provided by the framework (say, go into the pool and swim there). If you travel independently, you are composing libraries. You have to book your flights, find your accommodation and arrange your program (all using different libraries). It is more work, but you are in control - and you can arrange things exactly the way you need.

When reasoning about OO programs, it may be best to ignore the methods. Just look at the variables since the program is data centric. It's similar to how we ignore variables and just look at function input and output in functional programs

=== ===
what makes data flow diagrams higher level than control flow diagrams? 

I'm not sure. Maybe a sequence of control flows result in one data flow but the converse is not true.

But what makes functional programs higher level than imperative programs? Maybe because they enforce flow of data with each control flow so you can't write low level statements

In the old days (that is, about forty years ago), manframe computer users would type up their programs onto punch cards (cards with rectangular holes punched in them) and then hand the stack of cards over to the computer operator (who wore a white lab coat). When the operator got a bunch of stacks of cards, he would put them into the hopper and run them all through the computer. The computer would chew them over and print out a few feet of greenbar paper (wide paper complete with sprocket holes and alternating shadings of green to make reading the printed lines more easily). If the user were still hanging around when the job was run at midnight, it was amazing to watch error messages print out at 1100 lines per minute.

So why am I telling you this? Well, it's sort of an analogy. You write the program code for your brain during the day when you study or work problem sets, or read, or think. Then, when you go to sleep each night, the little guy in  your brain (in his white lab coat) takes all that information and puts it into the hopper to process it.

In other words, your brain works on your daytime learning while you sleep, sorting it out, processing it, cementing it into long-term memory, and just washing it down to make it clean and presentable.

unix (shell) pipes are limited because they are only unidirectional, but if I followed status quo these days the implementation would have been a monolithic OO app

This came about as an experiment relating to using a severely restricted language (in this case AWK) to implement a fairly complex application. Working under Unix with minimal tools is yielding ways of thinking I haven't considered since my hardcore Unix days in the 80s.

Nothing mind boggling here, but it did strike me as interesting from a monolithic super language vs small language in a unix environment perspective.

Welcome to the world's most widespread dataflow architecture!
I've always felt that as programmers moved to Unix-like systems from more inflexible environments, they brought their monolithic programming habits with them, neglecting the native tradition of program construction out of small, sharp tools.
Can anything be done to revive this potent tradition before it exists only in the aging memories of old farts and in the out-of-print and obsolete books of fallen Bell Labs demigods?
BTW, in addition to Unix pipelines, there is also Paul Morrison's Flow-based Programming, which uses the same general architecture in the small. FBP is interesting because it was explicitly designed with the needs of business application programming in mind.

A named pipe is very much like a TCP socket (which also has a persistent name in the form of an IP/port); server and client processes can independently attach to it, without having to be otherwise related

A lot of programs (running under Unix) tend to forget (or ignore) the rich patterns within the unix environment itself. Fork is not that expensive (anymore); socket/pipes are not inherently slow IPC mechanisms; init will spawn and manage long running processes; inetd will do TCP/IP connection management for simple one->one server apps, syslog is the standard log facility; etc.
The "Unix Way" is certainly not the end-all. It has its many defects and limitations. But I've seen a lot of C++ code that goes out of its way to be a "world unto itself" (even when it was intended to be deployed under Unix).

You can reword Greenspun's tenth law of programming onto unix (with apologies): Any sufficiently complicated monolithic program (under Unix) contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of the Unix Environment.

===  ===
Flow-Based Programming is an approach to developing applications, not in terms of the old von Neumann paradigm, but based on the concept of multiple asynchronous processes communicating by means of streams of data InformationPackets? passing over BoundedBuffer connections. In addition, a process identifies its related connections via Port names, rather than directly, and the network defining an application is defined externally to the internal logic of the processes. An application is viewed as a system of data streams being transformed by processes, rather than as a single "dumb" actor doing one step after another until all the data is processed. By "system", we mean that lots of processes are proceeding concurrently - it is the BoundedBuffers that make sure that all of this can still be done using finite resources.

This approach involves a paradigm shift which profoundly changes the way developers look at applications, and, although this concept is similar to ideas current in the area of distributed and parallel systems, up until now it has not been recognized that it is also an extremely productive approach to improving programmer productivity and application maintainability. The power and ease of application development and maintenance using FBP is an EmergentProperty of the attributes that make up FBP.

Most programming approaches, and discussions about programming, seem to assume a VonNeumannArchitecture, although people are beginning to network separate machines by means of data streams. However, it is very difficult to build complex applications on a (single) von Neumann machine, especially large data processing applications. Conversely, it turns out that, if you break your application up into small "machines" communicating via data streams travelling across BoundedBuffer connections, these kinds of applications suddenly become much simpler.

The addition of the concept of Port in turn allows each "machine" to potentially become an individual reusable component as it doesn't know the name of the other machine(s) it is communicating with - see ConfigurableModularity. This in turn means that the application becomes essentially a list of connections, which can be generated by a graphical tool if so desired. A "connection engine" (scheduler) is used to relate port names to the real network, and to drive the individual processes.


The connections constitute a DirectedGraph, usually acyclic, but not necessarily.



===  ===
A number of different types of 4GLs exist:
Table-driven (codeless) programming, usually running with a runtime framework and libraries. Instead of using code, the developer defines their logic by selecting an operation in a pre-defined list of memory or data table manipulation commands. In other words, instead of coding, the developer uses Table-driven algorithm programming (See also control tables that can be used for this purpose).

Unix shell scripts give a good example of a domain-specific language for data[3] organization. 

Even though Unix scripting languages are Turing complete, they differ from general purpose languages.[clarification needed]

In practice, scripting languages are used to weave together small Unix tools such as AWK (e.g., gawk), ls, sort or wc.

===  ===
One (very) simplistic genre of DataflowProgramming are Unix filter pipelines. They are used quite extensively, too, by experienced shell programmers.

A very interesting bit of history: DougMcIlroy was very interested in what amounted to FlowBasedProgramming very early on, starting from an interest in coroutines, and his continued insistence led directly to the implementation of the less-powerful but more manageable Unix pipes by Ken Thompson.

In 1964 (at Bell Labs, but well before Unix efforts began) DougMcIlroy wrote a memo that said in part "We should have some ways of connecting programs like garden hose - screw in another segment when it becomes when it becomes necessary to massage data in another way. This is the way of IO also." Quoted on Dennis Ritchie's site at https://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/mdmpipe.html. [Ignore the second "when it becomes".]

the pipeline is merely a specific form of coroutine

M. D. McIlroy, a long-time advocate of the non-hierarchical control flow that characterizes coroutines. 

The new facility was enthusiastically received, and the term `filter' was soon coined. Many commands were changed to make them usable in pipelines. For example, no one had imagined that anyone would want the sort or pr utility to sort or print its standard input if given no explicit arguments.

the one-input one-output model of command execution seemed too confining. What a failure of imagination!

The genius of the Unix pipeline is precisely that it is constructed from the very same commands used constantly in simplex fashion. The mental leap needed to see this possibility and to invent the notation is large indeed.

One of the comforting things about old memories is their tendency to take on a rosy glow

Nevertheless, it did not seem so at the time; the memory fixes on what was good and what lasted, and on the joy of helping to create the improvements that made life better. In ten years, I hope we can look back with the same mixed impression of progress combined with continuity.

Obscure shell syntax

==== Process substitution ====

* Piping the stdout of a command into the stdin of another is a powerful technique. But, what if you need to pipe the stdout of multiple commands? This is where process substitution comes in.


Using output of a command as a file, that can be the input of another command

syntax:
	<(cmd arg1)

examples:

	grep "hello" <(echo "hello my name is Sridhar\nGoodbye")


When cat was passed the file name it read it's contents for us, but echo just showed us the name that it was passed. This difference becomes more obvious if you add more substitutions:
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/17107/process-substitution-and-pipe

==== Pipe to multiple commands ====

syntax:
	tee file1 file2
	emit | tee >(cmd1) >(cmd2)

examples:
	find | tee >(wc -l) | sort  

==== multiple commands to pipe ====

syntax:
	paste <(cmd1)  <(cmd2)  | grep

	or

	cmd1 | combine_command - <(cmd2)

examples:
	paste <(seq 20) <(find) 
	paste <(echo "abc") <(echo "123") | hgrep 123

Good analogy. And "quarantine" is exactly the right word that captures this (back to Socrates and "wisdom is the definition of terms").

An alternate analogy that a guest speaker said in my spiritual leadership class said was: "When you get a thought while meditating, 'supressing' it is not the action you are taking. You are PARKING it." In other words, you return to it later.  

I keep forgetting to tell you - something profound my spiritual leadership professor said to me was - "Sitting still is not the only form of meditation. Walking alone in a quiet surrounding while looking at detailed objects is a form of meditation. Even writing is a form of meditation."

That was a eureka moment for me. I realized that I feel the need to write so many things down because it releases the burden from my brain, and I feel light again. So writing things down is not only good for my intellectual growth, but for peace of mind.

Everything ties together that we're discussing in separate emails in one way or another. I even found out how all of what I've said above relates to my job. I don't know if you'd get it but I'll tell you anyway, "Life is an endless graph database traversal of thoughts, where the graph database is your brain, nodes are people/objects/incidents, edges are the mind wandering from one thought to a (loosely) connected one." If I can tune this statement I can present it to my colleagues and impress them! More importantly, I think artificial intelligence will eventually digitize this process.

When I have trouble falling back asleep early in the morning I get great thoughts but when I wake up I've forgotten them. While I keep a pad of post it notes and a pencil by my bed, it's still difficult to reach for it in the dark. I just might keep it in the pocket of my pyjamas or under my pillow from now on (I keep my iPhone remote control in my hand as I'm falling asleep to turn off my podcast player anyway so it's not as ridiculous as it sounds).

"The greatest power that a person possesses is the power to choose."~~~~J. Martin Kohe (Pavithra) #Decoy_effect


Sridh??r S??rn??bat This has a lot of implications. There's a cognitive bias called "the decoy effect." I was wondering why people fall into the trap and it's simple: when you choose option A, you give up the opportunity to later choose option B or C. This doens't apply to everything. If you're unsure which book to buy or which item on a food menu to choose, sometimes you should just buy both and one of them will work out. But when it comes to, say, where you want to go today or which person to marry, as soon as you make a decision you forgo the other options. Which is why people apparently oddly, when presented with more options, end up doing nothing. But when there are limited or no options, you are more likely to commit.

I can't decide whether this is related or not, but one of the biggest lessons I learnt from a finance class was "with investing, TIME is your biggest asset."

A famous inspirational speaker said :
" Best years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman, who wasn't my wife. "
Audience was in shock and silence.
He added : "She was my mother"

A very daring husband tried to crack this at home.
After dinner, he said loudly to his wife in the kitchen :
"Best years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman, who wasn't my wife"
Standing for a moment, trying to recall the second line of that speaker.

A woman was helping her husband set up his computer, And at the appropriate point in the process. She told him that he would now need to enter a password, something he could remember easily and will use each time he has to log on.

A group of kindergartners were trying to become accustomed to the first grade. The biggest hurdle they faced was that the teacher insisted on no baby talk. 

"You need to use 'big people' words," she'd always remind them. She asked Chris what he had done over the weekend. "I went to visit my Nana." 

"No, you went to visit your GRANDMOTHER. Use big people words!" She then asked Mitchell what he had done. "I took a ride on a choo-choo." 

She said, "No, you took a ride on a TRAIN. Use big people words." She then asked Bobby what he had done. "I read a book," he replied. 

"That's WONDERFUL!" the teacher said. "What book did you read?" Bobby thought about it, then puffed out his little chest with great pride and said, "Winnie the Shit."

'Only pessimism sounds profound. Optimism sounds superficial.' But, at the end of the day, something still needs to get done. If all that has happened is that those with the courage to actually propose something have been devastated in the process , the organization will be filled with clever put-down artists and with inactivity. This situation arises because the people are so clever, and so determined to appear clever, that they will succeed at critiquing everything to death. It is always possible to find a reason to say no to some idea or proposal. People in many organizations are remarkably skilled at making excuses about why something can't be done, why something won't work, and, therefore, why the present, albeit imperfect, condition is better than trying somethind new and actually implementing new knowledge and ideas. Be very wary of judging people just on the basis of how smart they sound, and particularly on their ability to find problems or faults with ideas. These are dangerous people. They are smart enough to stop things from happening, but not action oriented enough to find ways of overcoming the problems they have identified..." (Knowing Doing Gap chapter 2 / page 45-46)

Carl Rogers (1902–1987) said that people are driven more or less by
two desires, the desire to grow, called self-actualization, and the desire for
self-acceptance.9 According to this viewpoint, the key to happiness is to live
our lives in accordance with our values. When people do things that are inconsistent
with their values, they lose respect for themselves, stop growing,
and become unhappy. Rogers’s theory represented an original effort to reduce
much of what is meaningful to us to a few overarching motives.

William James (1842–1910), the great American psychologist, philosopher,
and educator, and William McDougall (1871–1938), the brilliant Harvard
social psychologist, believed that behavior is guided by instinctual
desires. In his epic work, The Principles of Psychology, James provided the
following list of basic instinctual desires:

* saving the desire to hoard and collect
* construction the desire to build and achieve
* curiosity the desire to explore and learn
* exhibition the desire for attention
* family the desire to raise our children
* hunting the desire to find food
* order the desire for cleanliness and organization
* play the desire for fun
* sex the desire to reproduce
* shame the desire to avoid being singled out
* pain the desire to avoid aversive sensation
* herd the desire for social contact
* vengeance the desire for aggression

McDougall expanded and improved on this list.11 Together, James and McDougall
realized that human desire is multifaceted. They resisted the temptation
to reduce everything to one or two supermotives, such as Freud’s sex
and aggression, or Adler’s drive for superiority. James and McDougall were
the first influential psychologists to develop a comprehensive theory of basic
human desires.

Twinges of Jealousy when others get big compliments


It isn't weird, in that it is fairly common.

However, it is possible to get to a stage in life where you don't feel like that -- where you know you've got what it takes (whatever that is) and not every comment needs to be evaluated as a possible threat to, or validation of, your self-esteem. 

It can be hard to see the bigger picture and accept that not everything relates back to you, but there's a helluva lot of freedom in it too...

In fact, if you hand out GENUINE compliments to others....you will find it brings you a lot of joy as well.......

See, JR put it better than I ever could. It's not about disliking or hating the target of compliments....it's just like "c'mon, compliment me too!".

Based on these experiences, Dr Pereira says that "Our ideas of what constitutes a real man or woman are not natural; they are restrictive norms that are harmful to children of both genders.

At the most superficial level, beauty might be thought to carry a kind of halo around it; we see that someone has one good attribute, and by association, our subconscious assumes that they have been blessed in other departments too. “It’s one of many status characteristics that we can identify very early in our interactions,” says Walker.

Time = Love

Spend time together! If there's a mutual attraction to begin with, then the more time you both spend together will allow the two of you to become closer. He'll learn to love one-on-one time with you.

Eye Spy

A US study has shown that lovers spend 75% of their time together staring one another in the eye. Ensuring that you give your crush eye-contact encourages him to look you in the eyes too, therefore encouraging his brain to think about love.

For 14 days we get to stay home said my 3yo, 2 weeks ago ... He still says that . Back to work tomorrow ..he seems ready..looks like I need another 14 days to recover from the holiday blues ??? feeling depressed.

Forgive your enemies, but get even first
<!-- cousins who've hurt me -->

=== ===
I may not be able to remember what Sacramento cousin did (in fact it was in my best interest to forget it for my own happiness), but I remember how he/she made me feel. So I don't need to explain myself to them.

Trying to explain this to parents is going to be difficult because I can't remember. 

Same goes for the brat cousin (& Krupa, though since my future with Krupa isn't shut I can't afford to be that firm on my principled)

=== ===
I don't resent my mom for having low self esteem like me (disguising it with jokes like evil mother in law at grandad's book speech). What I resent is her never pointing out that she was the same and all the focus being on me, as if I was alone. 

To be fair, even she probably didn't have the self awareness to alleviate me of all the negative scrutnity. But still I can't help but feel that she covered up some of her deficiencies more arrogantly than I would (yes she may have been forced to by her surroundings but she should have not lumped me in the outside world)

=== ===
As I've said to mom on multiple occasions, she talks tough and defiant to me about her intolerance for others failings but in front of them is indecisive or shies away (worse still she interferes when I try to do it for her).
What's worse is that she can't see it and when I bring it to her attention that others didn't get the message, she claims she had "put her foot down".

When I begin to think "after mom's life is over I won't have to deal with it" I don't mean that I want her to die (don't even think about twisting my words if you're reading this and are shocked). What I mean is I'll not be in a lose/lose situation where I either priorities my intense love for her over the tense need to convince her when she's wrong so that I don't continue to get mislead.

Priya (and many daughters) disobey their mom habitually and I almost never do. While I'm much nicer than them as a child of my mother, never standing up to her makes me a clone of her weaknesses as well as her strengths.


=== ===
mannerless, manipulative, rude

e.g. Ebay cousin: is your wife with you? No not yet (or something else friendly as I did the first time). <end of IM conversation>

Indians (to some extent Americans) have a "use each other shamelessly for your own benefit" towards each other. Since both people have such a manipulative mindset, the recipient doesn't get offended because they are simultaneously doing it to someone else.

But when they do it to me and I don't do it to other people, I feel hurt and so avoid them in future.



=== ===
Aspergers
Even in school I would create written revision notes and cards while many others would rely much more on memory and "Cramming". I would often notice that others, upon completion of a course, lost their knowledge. This was because it was no longer in their working memory

I also feel mom used to humiliate me whenever we were in a religious environment. Like I was some ingrate who didn't devote my free time to the sites, sounds and smells of temples. The words "temple" or "puja" still leave me with remnants of feelings of fear. I equated those words with ridicule, punishment, humiliation, hostility

Mom never tolerated being comfortable with being lesser than others (so I can't be friends with manuwela)

I take it as a personal insult when parents praised others' children or people in the newspaper or on TV with special talents. Because they never praised me or bragged about me to others.

your ???circle of competence??? and ???ll it on your own. Create a niche where you are
the best. It doesn???t matter how small your area of mastery is. The main thing is
that you are king of the castle.

superficiality
when you get criticized or disagreed with, by the time you have proof that you're correct, the other person is no longer interested
e.g. I could have said in 1996 at school that I like Atletico Madrid but I'd have been accused of being a glory supporter
If I'd told them I support Atleti in the 2nd division they'd no longer care. Is this superficial social strength at play when people try to exert their power over you?

Wrong reasoning by mom

Mom: Is there any thank you after all the money and effort that I've put into your divorce papers?
Me: So, you want me to say thank you?
Mom: Not with words but with actions.
So if I don't follow her actions as she wants, then in her interpretation it's ungratefulness.

http://ideas.time.com/2013/10/02/the-facebook-effect-everybody-is-so-cliche/

They found that words like ???mommy,??? ???boyfriend,??? and ???best friend??? were more commonly used by women, while men tended to post words like ???Xbox,??? ???World Cup,??? and ???Chuck Norris.??? Women said ???sooo,??? ???yummy,??? and ???super excited,??? while guys said ???ftw,??? ???epic,??? and every possible variation of the F-word (we have a censored image of the real word cloud.) Girls used the word ???dress??? about as much as boys said ???engineering.??? Who used more smiley emoticons? Take a guess.

Dr. Kern is right. But remember the our Facebook statuses are not about who we are, but rather about who we wish we were. Social media isn???t about expression, it???s about performance. So the results of this study reveal less about who the subjects are than about how they want to be perceived.



For example, the ???female??? words seemed to be mostly relationship words, with the highly original additions of ???my hair,??? ???shopping,??? and ???chocolate.??? So it seems like girls just want their Facebook friends to know that they are a) super pretty and fun, and b) people like them.


And while there were definitely references to wives and girlfriends, ???male??? words were about macho performance. 
So it seems like guys want their Facebook friends to know that they are a) mad tough and b) they don???t give a F???.

Facebook is not the place for breaking norms, it???s where we go to have those norms reinforced. If a girl is at home coding a new app, she probably wouldn???t post about it online. If a boy is snuggling with his kitten, updating his Facebook status might be the last thing he???d do.

But how is it that the most cutting-edge social technology reinforces our most outdated conventions? If social media is about projecting a cool image, and that image is still so hackneyed, then we have a lot of work to do.

It???s posturing that everyone does and everyone denies. In a TIME poll on happiness in June, 76% said that other people made themselves look happier, more attractive, and more successful online than they are in real life. But 78% of pople said that their own profile reflects how they really are. Sounds like a lot of pots looking at a lot of kettles.



???There???s certainly this image-management aspect to everything, even who posts anything,??? she said. ???But even if that???s an image, that???s how all your friends start to see you

Rather, a mother can be comforted by her son's continuing need of her love and support. She doesn't need to worry about losing her appeal in her son's eyes, whereas with her daughter she feels like a wilting flower. Fathers dote on their daughters for the same reason. With their daughters, Dad can remain on a pedestal unwavering. He doesn't have to worry about being strong or manly, because in his daughter's eyes he can already move mountains. With his son, however, a manly-man status must always be kept, for fear of losing his title as man of the house."
=== ===
being dedicated to excellence is a desire to gain approval of strangers because you can't get enough from your social circle
e.g. Maddie's mom from "Dance moms." The mom dedicates everything to making Maddie a star because she thinks the success/perfection will make her kids happy.
I bet you anything, after watching a few youtube clips plus the first 5 minutes of the first episode that Maddie takes drugs, experiences severe depression, mood swings, physical health issues and troubled relationships (though to be fair physical health issues and troubled relationships happen to 80% of people)

The Loner is a quiet creature. It has no one natural habitat, but is found usually on its own in a quiet place. The Loner is a solitary creature; the human counterpart to the Lone Wolf. Loners are subtle and charming, however they usually tend to be single simply because being a Loner mostly means that one does not have the care for another person or a group of friends. The Loner is rarely seen with more than 3 people at any time unless at a concert, dance, or other social gathering. Loners are usually very kind, as what small amounts of contact they have with others means a lot to them. The Loner doesn't rely on other people to define their existance. Things like school drama pose little more than entertainment to the Loner. Loners don't rely on others, and as a result are completely self-sufficient and know how to not look like a friendless loser when confronted with a situation with no friends around. Loners can be one's lifelong friend, voice of reason, and an all-around great person if someone took the few seconds and tried to be worthy of a Loner's precious time.

someone who doesn't need other people around them to validate there own existence.

Those "Like if you care, ignore if you don't" photos -- It's already pretty lame that you got suckered into liking something because you're actually afraid people will think you're cold and heartless if you don't like it. But do us a favor and stop spreading the lameness to the rest of us.

Sappy and mushy declarations of undying love -- Ok, we get it, your husband is all kinds of awesomesauce. But status update after status update deeming him to be the King of all Prince Charmings and telling us how nauseatingly perfect your marriage is only makes us think the opposite must be true. If you really love your spouse that much, go the old-fashioned route and write him a love letter -- and keep it between the two of you.

Why do people go to nightclubs?

as far as i see it....for attentions ...one night stand and to mingle with other people for the most part....(i dont club btw) however there are other reasons like...bday..having fun or celebrity sightings...but for the most part(meaning 70 percent of the time) guys wanted to get laid n girls want to be the sex object of guys imaginations...

As far as others, people love to get away from their every day home life. Some are alcoholics and like to be around a group of people versus being alone, or they want to meet someone.

=== ===
People want to be mentors for selfish reasons
e.g. Christian is happy to make Kofi Kingston a big deal because Kofi will remain subservient to him after Kofi rises to the top (Team Kofi Kingston)

apologizing first sets an example that the other party (even if more guilty than you) to emulate. Even if you don't feel like apologizing at the time you do, when the other person fulfils their part of the obligation you feel vindicated in your initiative.

relationship survival

be loving to everyone around you
your inner peace will dampen any tension with them
even your enemies.
lie down, block out the light, enjoy your rest
misery is a result of tension, and tension is the result of too many obligations. You need time to relax and unwind.
a love for others will disintegrate your own insecurities and demons



the money you took is our gift to you
I can advertise myself as a CEO of the largest company in the world on Facebook. Then I realize just how little the badge matters.
your future is under your control, and it is only damaged by impatience. The next 30 years of my lie are something to enjoy every day.
I am not dependent on anyone for happiness. Even wanting children is really a way to externalize my misery and hide it. With inner peace I will get all those things in whatever entropy of life unfolds.

It's me who is the fundamentally miserable one. Everyone else I try to expose is just enjoying their life.
People are just sprinkling their need for love in an innocent way. They don't have such a powerful, contemplative capacity the way you do

Like Salvatore Sincere - just say "I love everybody"
Like Poorvi said "Love is the answer to all life's problems"
Emma Lambourne also read out a passage on love
Leadership course book also talks about the love of the journey


People who wrong you have issues. It's not about you. You have nothing to defend. Just sympathy to give

For people you don't get along with, they have been a victim of your internal misery as much as vice versa.
* Others will become cooperative if you see beyond their issues and try to help them.
* You earn deep friendship this way

We HAVE to make assumptions about others' competency level, because otherwise we don't know how to react to our interactions with them.
e.g. an instructor who says you were told "multiple times"
Too often I assume others are better than me until proven otherwise. I never reach the stage where their limits become obvious beyond doubt
Though sometimes I do assume others have less prestiege than I thought (e.g. Hispanic who was a contractor at Google)
The safest (but hardest) thing to do is assume everyone no less or no more able than you.

Dual branding concept
	cannibalization
	marketing dollars
	positioning different

Canadian lessons
	seemed to have worked well
	cannibalization minimal, viewed brands as distinct (credit card applications only 18% overlap)
	created a shopping destination
	
Similarities (China vs Canada)
	//fragmented
	//expansion (25 store increase in 4 years vs international expansion plans)
	//commission vs vendors on commission
	//target age (20-50 vs 25-44)
	//guided
	
Differences (China vs Canada)
	//75% vs 100% stake
	//3rd largest vs "one dominant player"
	vs hugely successful
	//??? (small real-estate) vs superstore format
	//focus on function rather than brand
	//information not shared as openly in supply chain vs ???
	national pride vs ???
	income growth
	second-tier cities  vs primary cities
	//35,000 vs 86,000 sq ft store size
	//product overlap (household vs entertainment)
	
	


Decision
	No dual branding 
	More dominant players, so more cannibalization; alternate positioning already taken
	People will go to competitors rather than sister brand
	More marketing dollars needed
	Slow consumption growth.
	Purchasing Habits: lack of credit use, more saving

work situation

when I have a task that I'm not sure how to do, I need to understand in detail how the system works. Only then can I manipulate it to behave in the required new way.

Someone else will keep asking around until they are given the solution, and get sufficient (but not detailed) understanding of the system to be able to continue to sound proficient. Whether they really are or not I'm not sure. I'm on the cynical side of it and think they are hiding the fact they don't understand it and so their long-term utility is limited (e.g. in rearchitecting).

=== ===
It's not just me that seeks/manipulates sympathy from others as much as I'm shamed into thinking so. The same way I'd seek a female's sympathy (rather than be manly), there are sales people who you have no interest in but often hear them out out of sympathy

Bullies will rarely pick on the student who has many friends, they'll pick on the loner who has no one to back him up 

Join in with groups of like minded people. You will have a better chance in a group (safer in numbers). Bullies are cowards, they will usually pick on the loner or the one that shows fear of them...the weak individual. Bullies seldom go after the individual with a high self-esteem or the one with a good peer support system.

I'm feeling depressed because of my life struggle (divorce) that others don't have.
But here are Others' life struggles

Priyal parents divorce
Gaurav's parents friction
Ketki depression from new college and relatives judging her relationship with Vishesh
Krupa college, visa anxiety
Tanuja miscarriage
Tejashree being rejected based on parents not liking muslim in-law
Bhumika home schooling, and father alcohol abuse
Murali alcohol abuse
Divya Sharma mother passing away
Mamtha father passing away

I always feel the need to thank people when they do something mutually beneficial

e.g. Teju spending time with me at Gautam's wedding (wanting to buy her something nice)
Ketki for keeping me company through the loneliness when I had no one else (well, I did have Krupa's mom)
Kavitha M for inviting me for dinner with Amit and Navneetha (which turned out to be awkward)

=== ===
in defence of call girls

socially anxious people need hugs too but there's no way to get them as a service the way you can almost everything else in life. You can't even ask a therapist for a hug. So a call girl is the only way to get it.

I think this is also the reason why people seek refuge in pets. Pets you can stroke, squeeze or have sleep with you.

=== ===
convenience friend
A person who is only around when it is easy and convenient for them. They are the people who, if not placed around us, (ex. dorm rooms), all the time, they wouldn't really be friends. They are usually used to do things for you, if you need a ride to and from school, etc. They are basically friends who need you around when they need a favor, or when they are just so bored out of their minds that they would rather hang out with you than sit around all day, but they'd never put you first.

8.  Streaming conscious:  “The escalator at work broke… guess we are all taking the stairs today!”  “Can’t believe how much the guy in the elevator smelled… PU”  The guys who made Twitter gave you a forum to bore people, so stop ruining my creepy afternoon of rifling through college girls’ spring break pictures.

7.  Yo! Internet friends! My real friends are real:  “Had the best Friday ever with Sarah B. and Rachel R.!  Love you bitches. J”  And if you click on either of the names I linked to, you can see that these friends are in fact real.  Also, you can check out my 75 photos I uploaded while I was still out on Friday night with the very same “bitches.”  So, no big deal, but I totally have real friends… and I’ve proven it with an abundance of internet evidence for my internet friends.

6.  Couples Communicating via Social Media:  Really?  At no point you thought it would be weird to ask your boyfriend what “our” dinner plans were via his facebook wall.  “Babe, what do you think of chicken tonight?”  Annoying couples, what do you think of email, text message, or phone calls?  Probably not much, considering you are fielding bland questions from one another for all of the facebook world to comment on… literally.  Seriously, we all know you guys are dating from the 9000 photos you’ve uploaded during your 3 month relationship and constant “like”-ing and commenting on each picture and status updates.

5.  Newly Weds Boasting about being Newly Weds:  “Me and the hubby are redecorating!  Somehow he thinks everything matches!”  I wonder what percentage of people find out they weren’t invited to a wedding this way?



3.  Using your baby for attention:  “Little Emma is keeping me up all night!”  Hey, mom of the year, maybe little Emma doesn’t want her sleeping problems broadcasted to the world so you can receive some viral sympathy.

2.  Pat me on the Back:  Narcissists, every time you receive a promotion, pass the Bar, ace a test, or finish a ½ marathon, you don’t need to update your status.   Is this really the only way that you can feel joy from accomplishments, by not-so-subtly begging bored people at work to congratulate you over the net?

 people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions.

=== ===
AS is a “pervasive developmental disability.” That is, people with AS may often appear or act younger than others of the same age. Children with AS often show delays in multiple areas of functioning, such as gross or fine motor coordination, social skills, or executive functioning (organization, prioritizing, and follow-through). However, they also continue to develop and mature—on their own time-table. Some people with AS may have specific gifts in mathematics, literature, or the arts. There is strong evidence that such superstars as Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, code-breaker Alan Turing, and musician Glen Gould, among many others, all had Asperger Syndrome. Today, too, there are adults with AS who are successful as professors, lawyers, physicians, artists, authors, and educators. For this reason, many people with AS, and professionals who know them, consider AS a difference rather than a disability. The brains of people with AS seem to process information and sensory stimuli differently than the brains of neurotypical (NT) people. This can be a source of difficulty, but it can also be a strength. For example, people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions. On the other hand, the same people may be too perfectionistic, become too obsessed with details, or have so much trouble seeing the big picture that they cannot complete a project.

eg. SCU security wanting me to wait while he was talking to some maintenance vehicle and telling me that I was complaining about something that was meant for my benefit but what he didn't remember was I was just quietly about to move around it before he started mouthing off and I told him he was in the way.

hollow recommendation

servers don't need software upgrades or OS upgrades the way desktops do. User interfaces are minimal or protocol based

Real life is full of errors, unlike models (even statistics talks about this with type 1 and type 2). One has to be forgiving as a recipient of others mistakes.

Feeling hurt (e.g. by a boss who fires you, a dance class evaluator who fails you, a friend who is drunk and behaves rudely to you, a driver who honks at you on an unfamiliar road) will only make you suffer more. Forgiveness and sympathy is a much healthier solution.

And when you make a "mistake", others should not retaliate (e.g. sibling who gets angry if plans change) or discipline you (e.g. putting the blame on the project owner/agent). If they do, it's their immaturity that is at fault, not the person who made a sincere effort.

Note to parents, teachers and addults in general (especially Indian adults)

cell phones are a part of life now. Deal with it. Has your phone never gone off during a speech?

pre-marital relationships give you a better chance of finding the right life partner. Just because your parents ddn't allow it doesn't make your era superior. Back in your day, your grandparents were alarmed at the thought of a TV in the bedroom.

Girls wear revealing clothing because that's what clothing stores sell. And clothing stores sell them because there's higher demand for them. don't make your children fight a whole market for your pride. They won't win.

Kids spend time on facebook instead of outdoors because their parents relocate more than our parents did, and they take your childrens friends with them. We live in an era where they dont have the luxury of growing up with the same neigghbors for 18 years. It's called economic progress.

If you think TV today sucks today, I agree with you as long as you accept that your parents think TV in your day sucked . It's us stuck in out old ways. And our favorite TV show probably sucked compared to what came before. Same with music.

Actresses of yesteryear were hotter than the ugly freaks of today. But your favorite ones were ugly compared to the ones before

Every movie today is only 3 stars according to critics. Only in their childhood did 5 star movies, right?

People today have short attention spans because the have the option of not being forced to sit through 3 hours of garbage the way you had to. Delayed gratification exists, just not very often. The ability to exit boredom is ingrained in the human psyche. Your generation just didn't have the means to escape it.


Why are you not allowing your kids to use computers from a young age, which are a necessity for work and play? You should be more worried about their effect on you.

Don't use words like "cool" and "stuff" and "shit" in your adult years. You should have accumulated enough vocabulary by then to use something more precise. You just sound desperate to look younger than you are.

Self esteem is vital for kids. If you obsess over it, good. If you verbally abuse your child to "keep them respecful" you'll end up with children who still need you aged 35 for every little problem they have.

Reacting to rude people
(e.g. parents ridiculing divorcees proposals, cousin of a friend talking with hostility to stranger, friend who got angry at arriving late for birthday, drivers honking, colleague who speaks with no politeness)
Say these things to yourself, not to them. Don't give them the satisfaction of a response.
* I will not dignify your comment
* I will not lower myself to your standards
* I am sorry you consider me beneath you
* Your opinion is about as welcome as pork in a mosque
* I respectfully disagree
* Thankfully, many people do not share your view

How polite you are in response depends on who the rude person is (e.g. an elder, or an immature kid)

Remember they will calm down even without any intervention from you. You don't need to artificially quash their rage.

Remember that it's always the one who blames who has issues. Someone without issues doesn't need to condemn to feel above something in the social pyramid

Don't respond to them in text. If they don't reply back to you, you'll feel like you wasted your time and looked like the fool.

People say controversial things and don't own them later. A few years later people will shrug their shoulders and say they don't believe it anymore. I on the other hand justify each and every viewpoint I have at the time I had it. I have more of a constitution.

You can't unsay something, so it's usually better to keep quiet. Almost nothing you say will put you in a better position.

Long term, you will remember a lot more what you do than what you hear (cone of learning). So don't prolong the unpleasant memory by participating 

=== ===
Don't let rude or impolite people get to you. You don't deserve to have to listen to them. Stand up for yourself politely and quietly without seeming rude or arrogant yourself. Show them you're better than that by ignoring them or acting as if it doesn't bother you. Most importantly, never bad mouth anyone in public, you never know who may overhear you. With a little splash of bad luck, you'll say it right under the nose of a teacher and get in trouble.


=== ===
When others, even perfectly affluent people, are rude (e.g. colleagues, dance instructors, cousins) for no reason it does hurt but instead of thinking there's something wrong with you, just be grateful that you were taught politeness - which they were only taught selectively.

Also, remember that the average person doesn't realize how sensitive you are.

times I did the right thing by not saying anything

* Teju house 2006 
* Pranjal being a jerk

Not so sure about these:
* Ajay calling me out on never being free for lunch
* Ali constantly making inappropriate small talk or jokes
* Jaspreet trying to maintain acquaintanceship with me.

Things I would say if I was making a speech and was famous enough to have the respect of the audience.

* Be nice to people. It costs nothing
* Give children the same respect that you expect for yourself or any adult.
* What's really true is not as important as what you believe is true ( this is the case with religion)
* Any degree gives you valuable knowledge
* spend your money on your brain. No one an take it from you.
* There are exceptions to every rule

???Pessimists are usually right and optimists are usually wrong but all the great changes have been accomplished by optimists.??? ??? Thomas L. Friedman

???Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so.??? ??? Noam Chomsky

???I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death.??? ???

What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places???and there are so many???where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.

The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.???

Optimism

???Promise Yourself

To be so strong that nothing
can disturb your peace of mind.
To talk health, happiness, and prosperity
to every person you meet.

To make all your friends feel
that there is something in them
To look at the sunny side of everything
and make your optimism come true.

To think only the best, to work only for the best,
and to expect only the best.
To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others
as you are about your own.

To forget the mistakes of the past
and press on to the greater achievements of the future.
To wear a cheerful countenance at all times
and give every living creature you meet a smile.

To give so much time to the improvement of yourself
that you have no time to criticize others.
To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,
and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.

To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,
not in loud words but great deeds.
To live in faith that the whole world is on your side
so long as you are true to the best that is in you.???

Wrong parenting by mom and dad

Praising others kids more than us
e.g. Priyal more than Priya
In mom and dad's defence, they didn't realize the effect it would have on us because they either did not have it done to them or, more likely, they didn't know any other way (social networking etc. didn't yield so many insights) or felt they were too clever to have blind faith in their kids the way most stupid parents would. They didn't knowingly try to put us down. They just felt it was the responsible thing to do to make us aware of our limitations.

Game theory

Be grateful to people who are rude. They are not being manipulative and you know what they really think. It is valuable information in your decision tree. Politely declining something can mislead you to wrong conclusions and suboptimal actions. However, being ruder than is necessary to communicate true thoughts is just poor manners. It's not so obvious which of the 2 cases you encounter in a given exchange

Also be grateful when people show off. They're sharing valuable information. however, you need to be aware of the false glamour (selection bias)

also this is true of complaining and criticism (though many people do it in a humiliating/non-constructive way). The key is you have to extract the valuable information and throw the rest away).

aksu notes 2014-11-05

don't give bad news before it materializes. It may get cancelled out by another component failing and making your failings irrelevant.

Deep down I'm asking for a permission to fail without punishment. Most people ask for forgiveness rather than permission in the case the failure isn't immaterial.

For example, when Aksu is running late for a patient first thing in the morning she doesn't state so before she knows the patient is waiting. Often the patient himself is running late and neither party needs to answer to the other.

In my work, I might not be able to get a bug fix done on time but I shouldn't say I'm behind schedule unless a customer is complaining to my boss. It may be that the staging environment is completely broken and even if I'd fixed the bug on time the customer won't get the fix any sooner.

I feel happy after talking to Bhumika or Ketki. The ego boost of talking to young pretty girls makes me feel valued.

More generally, though I'm not bold enough to initiate conversations, other younger people are and it is to my benefit. I'm not sure how much of it is because I'm fun to talk to for an old person, and how much is simply the presence of me. Children crave full attention and parents often only give it partially. I give them my full attention because they bring me joy and status. It's like a little child who wants someone to play with her. This is the case with Varsha, Teju and previously Priya.

=== Computer humor ===
pubic

=== Confidence ===
I don't feel confident because I've never been used to being right/validated
So I can't transfer it to situations when I need the confidence
e.g. bystanders have never said "What Sridhar did to get revenge on that bully was so funny/ingenious, I'm glad he did that"
or on a forum "The way he gave that troll a taste of his own medicine was quality"
So when I'm in a bad situation with, say, a girl who rejects me I don't have the conviction to say "I'm good, she's the loser." Instead, I feel like the one rejected (e.g. by Tarynn)
By the time mom started standing up for me about my academic competencies, my inferiority had been ingrained. Or my mom's statements were conflicting (which happens often)
* e.g. Kudaris are not better than me - their papers just looked more impressive compared to a mediocre batch

=== Confidence ===
an abusive person wants to take the control away from you and make you powerless because some how they get off on it - makes them feel powerful and in control. The truth is they are extremely insecure and feel they have no control. Realize it is not YOU as a person - you are just an easy target. These people never change unless they seriously realize the damage they have caused 

Insecurity can lead to shyness. Children who have abusive parents tend to be insecure and shy by nature.

 Abusive fathers tend to be very controlling of their children. Being self-centered, they demand respect and unconditional love. They are insecure and are constantly looking for signs of defiance or disrespect. An abusive father may feel that a child has more power than he does and may misinterpret a child's action as misbehavior. He therefore inflicts physical abuse to regain control. An abusive father has a sense of entitlement, expecting his children to do as he says



To this day I am afraid to socialize and feel guilty when anyone is nice to me

I feel scared of people because I assume they don't like me until proven otherwise. A more confident person assumes they are liked until proven otherwise.



=== Conflict ===
No one ever regretted saying nothing
=== conflict ===
conflict between 2 individuals is usually their roles colliding, not their behings colliding
If you can separate the human from the role they are given, you might have a lot less bitterness (e.g. a boss; after you quit, the hatred suddenly is erased and you regret how you behaved)

=== Consequences of being sensitive ===
Refuse to be nice to people who initally spoke rudely to me (even if doing so will put them in a good mood)
e.g.

* partner

* they invite you to their house
* they give you food
* they let your children play with them.
* they say bad things about others behind their back to you <!-- Deepika about Haripriya -->
=== friendship/enemy lifecycle ===

=== How to be a normal human being / How to fit in ===

When someone walks in late to a class or meeting, turn to them and stare to make them feel as uncomfortable as possible

When someone sneezes in the middle of a speech being given, interrupt the speaker and blurt out a short phrase just in case some people ignored the sneeze. Apparently, evil spirits will be exorcised as a result of this phrase.

Ask someone how they are, then act surprised if they actually tell you how they are feeling.

When leaving a classroom or meeting room, don't feel it is rude to leave chairs untucked from the table. Afterall, the next group to enter the room love an impromptu assault course. 

Always shame a friend who points with their finger at anything. Unambiguous identification is, afterall, the least important thing.

At a restaurant or banquet, don't take your plate to the nearest bin, empty the food and put the plate in a pile. Someone else is payed to do that aren't they? Also, if they don't like the sight of half eaten food, it's their problem. And there are plenty of free tables in every restaurant.

If someone isn't going to be of benefit to you, such as an office neighbor who doesn't work in the same group as you, ignore them completely unlike your teammate who is your best friend since birth.

Never watch wrestling, because it's fake. Besides, their weekly show clashes with Church where more decent human beings worship God.

Whenever someone makes any kind of mistake when driving, press your horn. Mistakes are illegal. And those unlike me who have once made a mistake deserve intimidation.

Correct grammar is for old people. Using adjectives instead of adverbs is acceptable if you are not writing letters with feathers and ink.

If you are brilliant enough to write a book, dedicate it to family members who have no idea what the book is about. They'll be touched, as you would be when your mom dedicates her book on latest findings in schizophrenia.

=== Lumping my behavior with dad's and Priya's ===

Yes it's not fair for mom to always be told that she was the one who didn't raise us right, but she puts my more legitimate attribution of Priya's bad behavior to mom in the same category that dad blames mom for all 3 of us being unsatisfactory to him, and Priya blaming mom for me being the "idiotic son".

=== Odd human behavior ===
victims giving feedback in non-repeated games (e.g. students in college professor course evaluations)

=== Parenting ===
To develop a stable positive identity, girls have to be good at something. They are talented young women, but for years their negative behavior may have gotten more attention than when they excelled. Instead of ineffective points and levels behavior management systems,
* e.g. dancing - like Beyonce, who wasn't a queen bee at school it seems
=== Parenting ===
But I am suggesting that piling on praise is a more effective motivator for the rookie than the pro. And I'm saying, point blank, that you shouldn't worry so much when it comes to pointing out mistakes to someone experienced. Negative feedback won't crush their confidence, but it just might give them the information they need to take their performance to the next level.





=== Pathetic ===
People are rude to niceness because the victim is too nice to point it out
People are nice to rudeness because they are too cowardly to stand up to it.

The truth is - many peopole who talk rudely are not malicious people and deserve retaliation. They'll be a victim if you are rude to them (e.g. MK instructor). They've just never been taught manners.

In their defence, even you are perceived as some people who take everything seriously rather than in a slapstick way (e.g. SCU MGMT512 classmate). But you can't be serious all the time (you used to be and missed out on entertaining many people). So accept that other people are not always the ones who should change. 


=== Peace of mind ===
Accept that you aren't always of a sound mind, and don't make any decisions about how to deal with the situation. Just coast mentally for a few hours
There may be times you truly feel angry about someone. It's best to say to yourself "I'm not in a frame of mind to be objective right now" before you start making decisions (like who to ignore because you are feeling hurt by their behavior)
Solution: connect with another human being. e.g. post on a forum

I've always liked your bubbly nature and now that I am starting to know you a bit more, you seem very intellectual. I enjoy sharing quotes and reading your comments. You  have the most meaningful and apt comments.

==== Book Excepts ====

both from chapter 1 (Lovelessness)

2.

Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (Edinburgh, 1759):

"To what purpose is all the toil and bustle of this world? What is the end of avarice and ambition, of the pursuit of wealth, of power and pre-eminence? Is it to supply the necessities of nature? The wages of the meanest labourer can supply them. What then are the advantages of that great purpose of human life which we call bettering our condition?

To be observed, to be attended to, to be taken notice of with sympathy, complacency, and approbation, are all the advantages which we can propose to derive from it. The rich man glories in his riches because he feels that they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world. The poor man on the contrary is ashamed of his poverty. He feels that it places him out of the sight of mankind. To feel that we are taken no notice of necessarily disappoints the most ardent desires of human nature. The poor man goes out and comes in unheeded, and when in the midst of a crowd is in the same obscurity as if shut up in his own hovel. The man of rank and distinction, on the contrary, is observed by all the world. Everybody is eager to look at him. His actions are the objects of the public care. Scarce a word, scarce a gesture that fall from him will be neglected."

...

The predominant impulse behind our desire to rise in the social hierarchy may be rooted not so much in the material goods we can accrue or the power we can wield as in the amount of love we stand to receive as a consequence of high status. Money, fame and influence may be valued more as tokens of-and means to-love rather than ends in themselves.

How may a word, generally used only in relation to what we would expect or hope for from a parent, or a romantic partner, be applied to something we might want from and be offered by the world? Perhaps we can define love, at once in its familial, sexual and worldly forms, as a kind of respect, a sensitivity on the part of one person to another's existence. To be shown love is to feel ourselves the object of concern: our presence is noted, our name is registered, our views are listened to, our failings are treated with indulgence and our needs are ministered to. And under such care, we flourish. There may be differences between romantic and status forms of love-the latter has no sexual dimension, it cannot end in marriage, those who offer it usually bear secondary motives-and yet status beloveds will, just like romantic ones, enjoy protection under the benevolent gaze of appreciative others.

==== From a review ====
One root cause of our anxiety, AdB claims, is that our egos are forever leaky balloons forever requiring helium of recognition and love, but always vulnerable to pinpricks. The prescription: Don't take others evaluation too seriously - after all, "does an emerald become worse if it isn't praised?" Also, remember that the views of the masses are often perforated with confusion and error, relying on intuition, emotion, and custom rather than rationality. As Voltaire says, "the earth swarms with people who are not worth talking to"

Also, one must realize that the determinants of high status continually shift. For example, Spartans prized aggressive warriors; the Cubeo tribe in the Amazon prized those who killed jaguars. In contrast, peaceful saints were idolized in Medieval Europe, as were "gentlemen" in industrial England. Today, commercial success is our measuring stick - money signals success. But that definition also ties us to some new and unpredictable forces, such as our employer's success, flux in the global economy, and. technological change.

...

We are also quietly influenced by our peers, advertising, and other outside forces that shape our desires rather than listening to our own souls. We also "mis-want" - that is, we think new products will make us happier than they actually will. The prescription is that if we must continue to long for things, we must take care to long for the right things, and tune into our own true desires.

Finally, envy can be cured by realizing that anyone's achievements seem insignificant in the context of the millennia and the expansive wonders of nature. Also, we should always keep in mind that at the end of one's days, the value of love, true friends, and charity will outweigh the quest for power, wealth, status and glory.

tights that have left and right legs in different colors


=== Times I've been sensitive throughout my life ===
telling House she was hurting me
telling mom she made me feel less than Teju because only her children couldn't speak Kannada
being laughed at in school play

I don't use many words when writing
a lot is in my head due to my hyperactive mind
others write much longer pieces than I do (and perhaps they copy mindlessly)

=== Traits ===
* The Sridhar Test - see if the opposite argument can be made. Only when it's been considered am I willing to believe people's hypotheses (professors may find this argumentative)
** critical thinking
** It's unpopular with other classmates (like CM Punk is unpopular with the locker room)
** when the rubber meets the road - when reality strikes

I keep looking to acquaintances for that validation because I don't get that confidence from unconditional acceptance it at home

=== Unpleasant ===
When people have a low opinion of your competence when you can't fit to their system (MS Word)

=== Unpleasantness ===

=== Unpleasantness ===
==== Be nice to rude people ====
Those who matter will feel guilty
<!-- e.g. Tanuja?, MGMT512 professor -->



==== ways to beat unpleasant people (in decreasing order of preference) ====
* Realize that for you to win, they don't have to lose
** Even Krupa said this
** Some negotiation book review (Coopetition) said this too
*** "Their liberating message is that your competitor does not have to fail for you to win. "
** Ego gets in the way of this
* Be happy regardless of what they do. It will kill them seeing how happy you are.
** To remind yourself of this, smile when something bad happens <!-- though Zait did this and I don't want to associate any part of my behavior with his -->
** Convince yourself that you won, even if there's no definitive proof <!-- like that person on forum "I ruined you" -->
* Act cold and distant <!-- dormmates did that to me -->
** (risky) If they ask what's wrong, lie and say you're fine
** eventually they will have a nervous breakdown and beg you to be more open with them
** note - you may break them permanently and they'll never be happy again because they'll feel humiliated

When I think about this, I feel sorry for the opposition because they are going to lose if they mess with me!

Also, these techniques can be so powerful that you risk hurting them as much as you were previously hurt, and you may end up overstepping the limits (e.g. you may get revenge on a criminal, but those successes will be taken into how you deal with e.g. family)
* the more I think about it, it's not worth it. I don't want to hurt people that much.

I feel much more confidence and not feeling sorry for myself now. But in becoming a strong person I will not be a nice person.

One of the best ways to nullify threats against you is not care what the result is and deal with whatever happens.
* that could be very costly but your lack of conscience will make you do it.
* e.g. not care if your spouse is hurting your parents

Caring about making others happy is a weak position to be in
* Always my weak self is "putting a smile on others faces because it makes me feel good inside"

Bullies lack shame in commenting on things, not worrying about how embarassing it is for them too because they are being hypocritical or leave themselves open to retaliation or might regret it later (don't think of the consequences) - e.g. "**** off, no one likes you" could backfire with bystanders saying "I do", or "actually no one likes you " or getting in trouble for swearing
<!-- e.g. reminding bystanders why the bully things some victim is a loser - e.g. for imitating that person. As a pseduo bully I'd be too ashamed to even bring that up again. -->
Being the first to hate makes the other person fear
* so if you are rude to a rude family member, they actually gain respect for you <!-- e.g. brat cousin -->



=== Why I shaved my head part-bald ===
We all want to be younger. But the only way you can travel back in time is to travel forward in time first.

==== The 16 Basic Desires ====
The following is the list of basic desires recognized by Reiss’
sensitivity theory of motivation. Each of these desires is largely
unrelated to all others. Each forms a continuum between high and low
motivation. High motivation indicates that the desire is intensely and
frequently experienced, whereas low motivation indicates that the
desire is weak and infrequently experienced.2
Power is the desire to experience influence or what is sometimes
called self-efficacy or competence motivation. This desire is commonly
satisfied by achievement, leadership, or domineering behavior. When
this desire is satisfied, people feel competent and influential. High
power desire is associated with ambition, workaholism, or dominance;
low power desire is associated with a lack of ambition or submission.

Independence is the desire for self-reliance or what is sometimes
called autonomy. This desire is commonly satisfied by doing things on
one’s own without assistance from others. When this desire is satisfied,
people feel free. People with high independence desire dislike needing
others, whereas those with low independence desire enjoy being
connected to others or a greater reality. Low independence desire is
associated with romantic love.
Curiosity is the desire for truth or knowledge. This desire is
commonly satisfied by exploration or learning. When the desire is
fulfilled, people feel enlightened. High curiosity is associated with
exploration, whereas low curiosity is associated with experiencing little
interest in learning.
Physical exercise is the desire to move one’s muscles. This desire is
commonly satisfied by physical activity such as sports or vigorous
work. When the desire is fulfilled, people feel fit. High physical
exercise is associated with a need for activity, whereas low physical
activity is associated with avoidance of physical activity.
Social contact is the desire for interaction with other people. The
desire for play or fun falls under this desire because of the primal
association between play and social contact. This desire is commonly
satisfied by socializing with others through friendships, parties, clubs,
or events. When this desire is satisfied, people have a sense of
belonging. High social contact is associated with fun-loving behavior,
whereas low social contact is associated with a desire for privacy and
aloneness.

Vengeance is the desire to get even with others. This desire is
commonly satisfied through participation in competitive activities,
interpersonal competitiveness, or aggression. When this desire is
satisfied, people feel vindicated. High vengeance is associated with
aggressive behavior, whereas low vengeance is associated with
peacekeeping behavior or kindness.
Honor is the desire to be loyal to one’s parents, ethnic group, or
heritage. It includes the desire to show character and behave morally, as
defined by traditional codes of conduct. This is the desire that connects
people to their parents and ancestors. The desire is most commonly
satisfied by behaving in accordance with traditional codes of conduct,
following ethnic or family tradition. When people behave honorably,
they feel loyal and possibly righteous. High honor is associated with
moralistic behavior and concern with character. Low honor is
associated with unscrupulous behavior and a lack of loyalty.

Family is the desire to raise one’s own children. It does not include a
general desire for nuturance; it is limited to taking care of one’s own.
When this desire is satisfied, people experience love. High family
desire is commonly satisfied by centering one’s activities around one’s
children. Low family desire is commonly satisfied by not having
children.
Order is the desire for a predictable environment. It includes the
desire for cleanliness and ritual. It is commonly satisfied by rituals,
traditions, cleanliness, and organizing activities. When this desire is
satisfied, people feel that their lives are predictable. High order is
associated with rule-governed and compulsive behavior, whereas low
order is satisfied by preferences for disorganization, flexibility, and
ambiguity.
Romance is the desire for sex, including the desire for beauty. It is
commonly satisfied by romantic love. When this desire is experienced,
people feel lust. High romance is associated with sensualism, whereas
low romance is associated with asceticism.
Idealism is the desire to improve society. It is commonly satisfied by
becoming involved in social causes. When this desire is satisfied,
people feel that the world is just. High idealism is associated with
humanitarian activities, whereas low idealism is associated with a lack
of interest in societal affairs.
Status is the desire for social standing. (The desire for attention falls
under this desire). When this desire is satisfied, people feel worthy and
important. Status is most commonly satisfied by seeking wealth or
prestige, such as wearing expensive clothes, living in exclusive
neighborhoods, or joining exclusive clubs. People with high status are
attentive to issues of class, wealth, and prestige. People with low status
are inattentive to class, wealth, and prestige.

Acceptance is the desire for approval. When this desire is satisfied,
people feel self-confident and happy. When the desire is frustrated,
people feel insecure and unhappy. Acceptance is most commonly
satisfied when parents accept their children. To a lesser extent, it can be
satisfied by close friendships and intimate relationships. It is most
commonly frustrated by parental rejection. High acceptance desire
leads to concern with issues of criticism and rejection. Low acceptance
desire suggests a high capacity to tolerate criticism and rejection.
Tranquility is the desire to be free of anxiety, frustration, or pain. It
is associated with feelings of relaxation and calm. People with high

tranquility tend to behave fearfully and experience anxiety frequently;
those with low tranquility tend to be adventuresome.
Eating is the desire for food. It is commonly satisfied by preparing
and consuming meals. People with high eating are attentive to food,
whereas those with low eating are much less attentive to food than the
average person. Eating is associated with feelings of hunger.
Saving is the desire to collect and own things. A high desire for
saving is associated with hoarding, including hoarding money. People
with a high desire to save hate wasting anything. A low desire for
saving is associated with spendthrift behavior.

Its The Pursuit, Not The Prize
====    ====
To look at it another way, if we're looking for a suitable long-run meaning of life, we should look for goals that are good to pursue and not just good to satisfy.

Timothy Ferris is again worth quoting:  To find happiness, "the question you should be asking isn't 'What do I want?' or 'What are my goals?' but 'What would excite me?'"

You might say that for a long-run meaning of life, we need games that are fun to play and not just to win.

The importance of this destination far outweighs the journey; you don't want to go there, you just want to be there.  There are many legitimate goals of this sort, but they are not suitable as long-run fun.  "Cure cancer!" is a worthwhile activity for us to pursue here and now

===  ===
It’s a long-running complaint amongst some men that only “certain” guys get all the women1 – the so-called “alpha males” who are tall, dark and handsome assholes with lantern jaws, fast cars, a six-pack and seven figure salary. All other men are just shit out of luck and may as well jump off a cliff; they’re evolutionary dead-ends, forever doomed to be unable to spread their seed and carry on their genetic lineage.

Women, others insist, are interested only in hypergamy; only men who offer some means of rising socially or economically are the ones getting all the sexing. Others will say that geeks are shut out because of a prejudice against brains or the socially awkward. Still others have equally arcane ideas of what women – apparently a monolithic entity of vast and unimaginable social power – want.

Of course, this begs the question of “if only a certain percentage of men get the majority of the women, why haven’t we died out as a species?”

The problem with this is that, frankly, the plural of “anecdote” isn’t “data”. People are prone to blind spots when it comes to a deeply held beliefs, an intellectual fallacy known as “confirmation bias”; that is, we’re only seeing the things that back up what we already believe and dismissing (or simply not seeing) everything else.

Now obviously there was a fairly wide variety in what people liked; after all, aside from some baseline factors built in that encourage survival of the species – facial symmetry, outward signs of physical health and ability to sire/bear offspring – what we find attractive tends to change based on cultural and emotional influences.

Women are drawn to men with passion in their lives. Too many people are content to simply exist, following a routine of “wake up, eat, work, eat, sleep, repeat” day in and day out, living out Thoroeu’s “lives of quiet desperation”. People with passion in their lives are driven. They don’t just meander or float through life, they have purpose. They have something they live for, something they care about with an intensity that you just don’t see often. There’s a part of their life that brings them fulfilment, that pushes them on and inspires them.

People who have passion are interesting. They have a certainty and assuredness about them because they love what they’re passionate about whole-heartedly and don’t worry about “maybe I shouldn’t get this excited over my favorite bands” or “maybe I should act my age instead of waxing rhapsodic about the power that books have over me”

Even if it’s not a passion that they both share, when someone is passionate about something and knows how to express that passion in a clear and attractive manner, it’s very hard not to get caught up in their enthusiasm and carried along by it.

The so-called “alpha” behavior that men often mistake for confidence tends to be selfishness and a lack of respect for others, not the knowledge of one’s own abilities and value.

Confidence is, ultimately a belief in oneself; the knowing what you’re worth and what you’re capable of even in the face of people who belittle or demean you. It’s knowing that you are equal to the trial at hand and the correctness of one’s path. Someone who is confident is tempered by self-awareness and humility; it’s less of an the idea that you can’t fail but the knowledge that you can succeed if you work hard.

A confident person knows what he’s worth and is willing to work to get what he’s worth rather than to assume that he just deserves it by virtue of existing. A confident person doesn’t cringe or whine at the first sign of trouble; they grit their teeth and push through it. A confident person in a relationship doesn’t let his partner walk all over him or expect her to be a substitute mother, telling him what to do and how to do it.

True confidence – that feeling of certainty and potential that comes with knowing to your core who you are and what you’re worth – is magnetic.


Intellectual Curiosity

It’s hard to believe in a world that brings us the Jersey Shore and Here Comes Honey Boo-Boo, but women like a man with a well hung brain. Too many men seem to believe that learning ends as soon as you’re handed a degree (if not sooner) while others seem to prefer to passively absorb whatever information comes their way.

Men who kindle their intellect, people who indulge a love of learning for learning’s sake on the other hand… they have passion. They take an active role in their own lives, seeking out new experiences and trying to improve themselves and their understanding of the world. These tend to be people with drive and ambition, rather than being someone who’s content to let the world pass them by while they kill time playing Call of Duty: None More Black Ops. A person who wants to cultivate their intellectual curiosity is someone who pays attention to the world around them and wants to engage in it, rather than being spoon-fed.

Some women adore bald men, others get weak in the knees for long hair and others will only date men with short hair. Some want their men clean shaven, others love facial hair with the passion of a thousand suns. Some women loved big burly men while others like skinny nerd-boys who look like the kid they could’ve met at Hebrew school.

Most women who mentioned looks preferred someone who cared about their appearance – someone who took the time to make themselves look nice 

The only feature that most women seemed to universally desire were nice shoulders. Shoulders seem to be the one thing women could agree on. Go figure.

But while you’re working on your lat raises and upright rows, think on this: women respond far more to drive and behavior than to looks. Spending a little more time brushing up on your feminist theory, building your confidence and cultivating your love for British television will go further to finding you the partner of your dreams.

male
1. Generally good people. But there are some examples of true assholes who do think that women are inferior to them and are just a means for sex. Not all are, but a select few need to get a serious wake up call. 

For those who don't, thank you for being a good person. For those who do, if you need sex that bad, here's a magazine, some lotion, and I hope you are smart enough to find your hand.
3. female 
An inferior species that, over the course of time, has not learned that it's purpose is sex. They have insisted that they be equal to men, when in fact, they could never be. Fat women should die. 
Rape is fun. Really fun.


====   ====
Feminine means "What pertains to a woman". There are no qualifications. Whatever a woman does is feminine, because they are a woman, and they are doing something that pertains to them. 

Of a woman. Traditionally, in most cultures, the expectation for a lady to be nurturing, demure, to care for her family, to look beautiful, and to be submissive to her husband(or girlfriend). 

Feminine traits include but are not limited to: understanding, empathetic, sensitive, submissive, gentle, modest, willowy, and pretty.

Many people with Asperger's enjoy learning the minutest details about their favorite topic. Unfortunately, they can get bogged down in the minutiae. Simply put: Aspies can focus too much on the parts instead of the whole. Asperger's individuals need to be taught how to see "the whole picture." For every task or activity, the Aspie should know what the final result should be or the goal that is to be met. Give frequent reminders to help keep him or her focused until the task is completed.

who took great pride in writing “the Rolls Royce” of computer code. However, he spent so much time trouble-shooting future scenarios and perfecting his work that he fell far behind his deadlines. 

He was angry when he received a low performance review, however he had lost sight of the big picture. The company did not need top-of-the-line code. They needed products that reliably answered customer needs.


Striving for perfection is a trap. It is an impossible standard to meet. Pretty much everything can be improved and improved and improved on … with the result that nothing gets done!


The one thing that I have learnt very belatedly in my career to do is, as you suggest, ask for help. Previously, I would have regarded this as a sign of weakness allied to the danger of appearing reliant on others which is another common problem for someone with Asperger.

individuals have sometimes been amazed to discover short cuts and processes that saved hours every week. Many realized that they were spending time on activities that were not important, or doing things that were completely unnecessary.

Virtually every person I have coached with Asperger’s Syndrome has been reluctant to ask for help. 

There are many other times when asking co-workers for their ideas and assistance is the smart thing to do. One of the signs of a good leader is “knowing what you don’t know,” and surrounding yourself with others who have the necessary expertise. This is good advice for people in any management role. Look at it as a skills exchange. What expertise do others have to share with you … and what can you share with them?

not because I feel that I cannot meet performance requirements – far from it. Technically I have always produced good work and have often gone beyond what is required.

I know of several people who did well in jobs that utilized their technical expertise, but could not handle management roles.

Technology can absolutely improve time management. For example, you can email reminders to yourself,

overwhelmed trying to update all of their different organizers! For some, a simple paper appointment book worked best.

=== Smiling Advice For Women ===
Research by Marvin Hecht and Marianne La France from Boston University has revealed how subordinate people smile more in the presence of dominant and superior people, in both friendly and unfriendly situations, whereas superior people will smile only around subordinate people in friendly situations.

This research shows that women smile far more than men in both social and business situations, which can make a woman appear to be subordinate or weak in an encounter with unsmiling men. Some people claim that women's extra smiling is the result of women historically being placed by men into subordinate roles, but other research shows that by the age of eight weeks, baby girls smile far more than baby boys, so it's probably inborn as opposed to learned. The likely explanation is that smiling fits neatly into women's evolutionary role as pacifiers and nurturers. It doesn't mean a woman can't be as authoritative as a man; but the extra smiling can make her look less authoritative.

Women's extra smiling is probably hardwired into the brain.

Social psychologist Dr Nancy Henley, at UCLA, described a woman's smile as 'her badge of appeasement' and it is often used to placate a more powerful male. Her research showed that, in social encounters, women smile 87% of the time versus 67% for men and that women are 26% more likely to return smiles from the opposite sex. An experiment using 15 photographs of women showing happy, sad and neutral faces were rated for attractiveness by 257 respondents. The women with the sad expressions were considered the least attractive. Pictures of unsmiling women were decoded as a sign of unhappiness while pictures of unsmiling men were seen as a sign of dominance. The lessons here are for women to smile less when dealing with dominant men in business or to mirror the amount of smiling that men do. And if men want to be more persuasive with women, they need to smile more in all contexts.

=== Laughter in Love ===

<p>Robert Provine found that in courtship, it's also women who do most of the laughing and smiling, not men. Laughing in these contexts is used as a way of determining how successfully a couple is likely to bond in a relationship. Simply put, the more he can make her laugh, the more attractive she will find him. This is because the ability to make others laugh is perceived as a dominant trait and women prefer dominant males, while males prefer subordinate females. Provine also round that a subordinate person will laugh to appease a superior person and the superior person will make subordinates laugh - but without laughing himself - as a way of maintaining his superiority.</p>

<p class="leftmargin1"><span class="h4"><span class="italic">Studies show that women laugh at men they're attracted to, and men are attracted to women who laugh at them.</span></span></p>

<p>This explains why having a sense of humor is near the top of women's priority list of what they look for in a man. When a woman says 'He's such a funny guy - we spent the whole night laughing together' she usually means that she spent the night laughing and he spent the night making her laugh.</p>

<p class="leftmargin1"><span class="h4"><span class="italic">From a man's perspective, saying that a woman has a good sense of humor doesn't mean she tells jokes; it means she laughs at his jokes.</span></span></p>

<p>On a deeper level, men seem to understand the attraction value of being humorous and spend much of their time with other men competing to tell the best joke to enhance their own status. Many men also become annoyed when one man dominates the joke-telling, especially when women are present and are also laughing. Men are likely to think the joke-teller is not only a jerk but he isn't particularly funny either, come to think of it - despite the fact he has all the women in fits of laughter. The point for men to understand is that humorous men look more attractive to most women. Fortunately, you can learn to be humorous.</p>

What's the most high profile match that's ever took place in your vicinity?

Just thinking about someone I know in Vancouver (who's not into football!) while the FIFA Women's World Cup final has been going on, it got me wondering: what's the most important match that you have ever been in close physical and temporal proximity of?

Notice when I say temporal, it means you must have been in the area at the time the match was happening. It's no use going to the Stade de France this year and saying you were right next to where the 1998 world cup final took place.

You don't need to have attended the match, just been in the same city or a nearby one.

It can be club or domestic football.

Their captain, Bobby Moore, would return to Wembley 1 year later to lift the World Cup (he'd also be the first in that starting 11 to pass away). The goalscorer, Alan Sealey, is the uncle of Leeds and Man Utd goalkeeper Les Sealey who would die 5 years after him from the same heart condition.
* Derby County won the English top division twice in the 1970s (managed by Brian Clough)
* Jimmy Greaves has finished as England's top goalscorer more times than anyone in its history.
* Arsenal were the most successful club in England until 1966 when Liverpool matched their 7 league titles. a year leater Man Utd also claimed their 7th league title.
* between 1980 and 1984, Northern Spain's Basque Country won all 4 league titles (Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao). Apart from those 4 years, only once since 1945 has a team other than Real, Barca, Atletico or Valencia won the title - Deportivo La Coruna in 2000.
* The last Italian team to win the league 5 times in a row was Torino in 1949 (before that it was Juventus 1935). If Juventus win the title in 2016, they will match that. Inter managed 4 in 2010 and Milan 3 in 1994.
* Many players have finished topscorer in Italy 3 times. But only 2 people have won it 3 times in a row - Frenchman Michel Platini in 1985 and Swede Gunnar Nordahl in 1955.
* In 2015 Luca Toni finished (joint) top goalscorer in Serie A, 9 years after his previous award of top goalscorer. No other player has won the award that far apart.
* Juventus have won the league 31 times. The 2nd most successful club, Milan, only have 18 yet have a stadium almost twice as large.

=== History of football ===
The victors of the Civil War allowed the professional Liga to start up again immediately afterwards, simply insisting upon the Castilianisation of all club names. So Athletic Bilbao grudgingly became Atletico and Sporting Gijon changed to Deportivo, when they were re-formed by the members who had survived the war and the purges that followed. But

some people here are soooooo pc... anyways lets not make a meal out of it eh!

Unfortunately its much too late for this.

Kenny backed Suarez and came out looking worse for it, don't expect Rodgers to show his full support here. Once bitten twice shy.

Atleast Anfield is now again a terrifying place for away teams to come and play....

I'll bite you in a minute you silly ****.

Suarez leaving the ground with Ivanovic's head.

Is true, which is why i'll be biting(sorry) my tongue as would be a knee-jerk reaction.

The FA propose new measures to deal with Suarez. #BTJ

Looked like a kiss to me.

TBF, Branislav Ivanovic is a mouthful 

I hear there's a new place to eat opened in Liverpool!

Jamie Redknapp has just said "At least Saurez showed some appetite in the game."

Its not like he has Rabies now is it.

They're saving the last bite until last.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to BBC Sport: "These games will get spicy."

No mention of what Ivanovic tasted like.

Post your honest-to-god views at 65 minutes

I've just realized - Klopp doesn't have it anymore. Some managers enjoy success for a spell but then the game changes and they never win a trophy again. And if you don't believe me just look at Rafa.

When you strip away the media hype, Klopp is just a 2016 Kevin Keegan who is passionate but gets found out by knowledge that is not cutting edge enough to make us competitive. He was the beneficiary of a well-run board in his previous club. The gulf in class today was embarassing. Come to think of it, Dortmund would be in the CL were it not for Klopp running them into the ground last season.

I've never seen so many misplaced passes in a season let alone 90 minutes. We looked like a bunch of donkeys who can't control a football. But I'm not dissing Sakho. He may have had a mare today but I said I like him and I'm not going to go back on that because I'm not fickle.

I wasn't around when the Kop would sing their hearts out but even compared to the Houllier days, Anfield shows about as much atmosphere as the ruins of the Colosseum in Rome. I couldn't hear anything on TV coming from our fans.

The sooner we admit we are just a club with a beautiful past but are just another club, the happier we will be. We're barely good enough to be in the Europa League let alone win it. Maybe it's better this way. If we were really good I probably would hate us the way I hated the Mancs all those years.

I just saw a latest episode podcast by the BBC saying "Special Anfield European Night." I like their sense of humour. I'm assuming they're referring to how much of a masterclass the Germans gave us.

===  ===
I've been a football fan long enough to understand it's pointless worrying about players leaving. Every player will go eventually and if it ends up being bad for their career (Owen, Fowler, Torres) it's not much of a consolation so one should take pride if they do well at a bigger club (Suarez, Alonso, Mascherano). We can say that those great players have an affinity with our club even if it's initially a blow to our pride.

The simplest way to get up and running is:

Copy your /etc/passwd (and /etc/group) files from your NFS server to your Windows XP client and point to them in User Name Mapping -> Configuration subtab.
In the User Name Mapping -> Maps subtab, check Simple Maps, select Show User Maps, and associate your main XP user account with your main Linux user account.
Click Apply
Browse your newly accessible NFS network shares by going to My Network Places -> Entire Network -> NFS Network -> Default LAN -> (IP address or name of server)

netcat
It is quite simple to build a very basic client/server model using nc.  On one console, start nc listening on a specific port for a connection.


nc is now listening on port 1234 for a connection.  On a second console (or a second machine), connect to the machine and port being listened on:

There should now be a connection between the ports.  Anything typed at the second console will be
concatenated to the first, and vice-versa.

 All it does is to take the data from stdin and transfer it to the other end across the network.

In this case, the keyboard acts as the stdin. Anything you type in the server machine???s terminal is transfered to the client machine and vice-versa.

The bash getopts builtin does not support long option names with the double-dash prefix. It only supports single-character options.

There is a shell tool getopt which is another program, not a bash builtin. The GNU implementation of getopt(3) (used by the command-line getopt(1) on Linux) supports parsing long options.

But the BSD implementation of getopt (e.g. on Mac OS X) does not.

netcat

Making any process a server
netcat can be used to make any process a network server. It can listen on a port and pipe the input it receives to that process. The -e option spawns the executable with its input and output redirected via network socket.
For example, it is possible to expose a bourne shell process to remote computers. To do so, on a computer A with IP 192.168.1.2, run this command:
 nc -l -p 1234 -e /bin/sh
Then, from any other computer on the same network, one could run this nc command:
 nc 192.168.1.2 1234
 ls -las

Things you need for a good command line experience

* mustn't screw up the environment, or must be easy to fix the environment
** Mobaxterm is annoying in that it creates its own user rather than use your windows profile
** cygwin also creates its own user but is easier to fix
* prompt and newlines must show up correctly
** Cygwin via MobaSSH fails with newlines if you edit the prompt. I don't know if it's the terminal or the shell that is to blame
** zsh for windows has issues, even on MobaXterm
* Supports ZSH
** Mobaxterm denies supporting it but I think it does in a roundabout way
* keyboard input for line editor working properly
** not working with anything on Windows, or with Mac Terminal. Apparently something to do with the shell, but I don't know yet. Bash seems to work correctly so zsh settings might be the issue. Usually the terminal application like iTerm has a way to remap the keys.
* copy and paste with mouse 
** MS Dos, or Git Bash for Windows are painful. You can't copy or paste without going to the app menu.
** Mobaxterm is good about this
* Colours
** MS Dos is not good about this, but there are alternatives like Ansicon
*** You need to use Ansicon for wrapper terminals like console2 to get color.
** Git bash somehow has this built in.
** Conemu has colours by default I believe

=== ===
Without this you don't get colored output at the command line:


export TERM=xterm-256color

I made a new xorg.conf file and xorg.conf.failsafe and copied the text from the failsafe to the xorg.conf as you said. Now my computer boots without the "low-graphics" error! Thank you! Before I had to reboot and chose "recovery mode" and then chose continue in normal mode, which took ages. But could this fix somehow be the reason why the pc internal speaker is suddenly on even though my computer is connected to my stereo? This has never happened before. ??? 1kb May 18 at 10:46

With imperative code, the additional complexity is shoved into a series of steps. For-loops get bigger, and branching gets deeper. At some point, procedures reach several hundred lines in length, often with the components being written by different authors and conceptual integrity being lost. 
=== ===

Oracle Coherence is a Library

=== ===
Framework = separate server
Library = embedded server
=== ===
Frameworks are intended for people who can't code but just fill in XML via GUIs (i.e. Oracle developers)
They do provide business value in cost savings, but the developers learn very little about designing system architecture or writing good code.

"Frameworks come and go but classic programming skills are forever."
=== ===

The Library way is the functional way where you can compose a complex operation from many small operations chained or composed together
(like Unix tool philosophy of doing small things well)

=== ===
Inversion of Control is a key part of what makes a framework different to a library. A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.

Great diagram:
http://tom.lokhorst.eu/media/architecture-framework-libraries.png

A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.

"Hooks"


=== ===
80% of the time frameworks make your life  more complicated. They are intended to solve such a broad range of problems that they make it indirect for you to achieve your very specific goal that you can directly solve without it.
=== ===
I don???t use frameworks, and rather than use one yourself I???d recommend making your own.

Frameworks are useful for speeding up the production of a project, once you???ve learned them. But until then they???re slow to use (because you???re working it out), hard to debug (because you???re working it out), and can limit your design - because you will end up altering the design to fit what you can do with the framework at the time.

Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing environment constructed according to his own design, using whatever means were available. His plans, it is evident in retrospect, incorporated many of the innovative aspects of Multics, including an explicit notion of a process as a locus of control, a tree-structured file system, a command interpreter as user-level program, simple representation of text files, and generalized access to devices. They excluded others, such as unified access to memory and to files.

Maven vs Ant
Convention and configuration over scripting. Maven has set conventions for project layout. It constructs classpaths based upon your declared dependencies and their transitive dependencies. With ant, you have to explicitly write out XML "code" for the steps to compile, to construct jars, to set up your classpaths, etc. Maven is much more declarative.

=== ===
The disadvantage of individualized native shell query commands is that they must be stateless (e.g. neo4j-shell cd etc. wouldn't be possible). There is no "visibility" - where you are (e.g. is the server up?). Fuse FS allows you to use pwd. But you could use a shell variable.

=== ===
Graphs are bad at showing temporal facts
e.g. how do you show that one method call occurs before another one? In a relational table it's more obvious

To enforce an ordering, put weights on the edges

ssh limitations that you don't have locally

=== ===
All the other systems track metadata; Git and hg just track content and infer the metadata.

Tracking content alone means doing none of that. When you commit, the VCS just records what the tree looks like. It doesn’t care about how the tree got that way.

git

when aliases are useful rather than key bindings

when you have to type a command name out because there are too many variations to assign each to key bindings (many of which don't occur frequently enough to use up a key binding with)

e.g. alias			mvn='mvn --quiet'

because assigning a command for test, install etc. is going to eat up too many key bindings and won't be used that often

If the commit you want to fix isn???t the most recent one:

git rebase --interactive $parent_of_flawed_commit

If you want to fix several flawed commits, pass the parent of the oldest one of them.

An editor will come up, with a list of all commits since the one you gave.

Change pick to reword (or on old versions of Git, to edit) in front of any commits you want to fix.
Once you save, Git will replay the listed commits.

Filters

Most operations have a "data" input and other inputs which are control related. The control ones can be function parameters (or command line options for command line programs) while the inputs can be the actual input (or stdin in the case of command line programs) 

Collection in - stdin
Collection out - stdout

Options, in theory, can be hardcoded (that's why they're optional - the program can still work without the user specifying them)

Java is conceptually made of three parts: Java, the programming language, the Java runtime libraries, and the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. If you???re familiar with Node.js, Java the language is analogous to JavaScript, the runtime libraries are analogous to Node.js itself, and the JVM would be analogous to V8. The JVM and runtime libraries are packaged together into what is known as the Java Runtime Environment, or the JRE (although often when people say ???JVM??? they actually mean the entire JRE). The Java Development Kit, or the JDK, is a version of the JRE that includes development tools like javac, the Java compiler, and various monitoring and profiling tools. The JRE comes in several flavors, like those made for embedded devices, but in this blog post series, we will only be referring to the JRE made for server (or desktop) machines, known as Java SE (Standard Edition).

Computer software is roughly divided into two main categories - application software and operating system software. Applications are programs used by people to carry out various tasks, such as writing a letter, creating a financial spreadsheet, or querying a customer database. Operating systems, on the other hand, manage the computer system on which these applications run. Without an operating system, it would be impossible to run any of the application software we use every day, or even to boot up the computer.

Disadvantage of 1 way sync
* If you delete from the master, the slave will also lose the file unless you leave enough lag between syncing

Disadvantage of 2 way sync
* same as 1 way, except it's worse because either way loses the data (a company shut down from this once)


Conclusion
* Use rsnapshot for undoing accidental deletion


* Recovery (versioning): jungledisk, rsnapshot, git
* Local access (when there's no network access; when): jungledisk, unison, 
* Backup: Startech duplicator, rsync
* Remote access (when you want to show something to someone while you're on the road, like a photo buried somewhere in your collection - not available in a gallery): ssh, sshfs, http server (e.g. webdav, python)

Immediacy is opposite of Recovery Window

						Immediately Consistent 		Recovery Window		Automatic Global availability	Seamless Access		Equal access (one is as good as another)
ssh							YES							NO													NO

* NFS::distance (I don't want to take my computer with me while travelling or lying on my bed)
** performance (I don't want to put up with slow speed) - mirroring/replication (drive duplication, unison)
** consistency (I don't want the data to differ in different copies) - network connection (ssh)
* DRIVE DUPLICATION::accidental deletion (I want to be able to recover something I used to have) - versioning (rsnapshot)
* DRIVE DUPLICATION::mechanical failure (I don't want to lose anything if my disk gets damaged) - mirroring/replication (drive duplication, unison, rsync)
* JUNGLEDISK::geographic disaster/theft (I don't want to lose anything if I lose everything in my home) - cloud storage (jungledisk)

The difference between BSD and Linux distributions dated back to the early days of Unix.

AT&T owned Unix, but due to restrictions it could not compete in the computing industry. Due to this, they licensed Unix to Berkeley. Berkeley took off with this customizing and tweaking everything until eventually there was no AT&T code really present in their new OS, named BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution.)

Enter a bit later, Linus Torvalds was in an Operating Systems class working with an incomplete Unix variant called Minix, which was meant to train students in building an OS. Linus took off with this idea and founded the Linux branch.

=== Does GWT use MVC? ===

GWT focuses mainly on the UI layer of a web-application making it easy to create and debug the HTML/Javascript layer because you code it with Java and use all the existing tools of Java.

I would like to add on to other answers in that GWT is mostly a client side library. You can communicate to the server via either GWT-RPC, or REST. 

In terms of development on UI, you have a few options, you can either develop using pure JAVA in GWT, use GWT's UI Binder feature, or create HTML and just add in GWT components.

** how much of your time the application is focussed 
** how far-reaching the application is network-wise
* The more often a command is required, the less buttons one should have to press

Is there a such thing as a set of standards for keyboard shortcuts? Maybe I should start one ;)
* There are but they aren't standardized for commands that are specialized or core to productivity

ram file system - i.e. no backing store. But useful at boot time.

=== Neo4j evaluation (why I like Neo4j) - MASTER COPY, but an alternate version for Objy created ===

I'm talking (mostly) as a newbie developer who is learning to use the DB, not an enterprise architect trying to scale to hundreds of hits at a time.

* neo4j-shell FUSE-like file system (but FUSE would be better so you can use key bindings, command history search, tab completion, dir colors, find command to quickly print paths)
* Embedded mode (preferred initially because of type safety, targetted exception handling)
** https://github.com/sarnobat/neo4j_embedded/blob/master/test.groovy
** Pure java to get all nodes, without ever having to care about any query language (initially)
* Cypher - readable, handles all cases I care about
* Cypher over REST. Not restricted to pure REST GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests
* No need for strong types. It's just an extension of a java.util.Map
* Replication (though master-slave only; not free. Better than nothing - it's reassuring)


What I don't like:
* No remote java database connections like SQL (so non-rest java code must reside on server)
* Pure REST querying - can only do basic queries; output is bloated; no results without autoindexing (I don't want to learn about indexing yet - I still don't know what indexes are)
** REST Output is bloated - but done for discoverability (which in practice isn't that useful)
* Cypher - having to check a property exists before evaluating a predicate on it
* Transactions over REST not possible
* No introspection (I assume; but I've never tried it)
* No asynchronous transactions like Couchbase

=== What is an Operating system ===

Resource management - reduce slack time (that's the main reason for multitasking)



An I/O operation is orders of magnitude slower than instruction execution.  For this reason the processor would sit idle a large proportion of the time, despite the efficiency improvements brought about by batch systems.  Instead of doing useful work, the processor would wait for an I/O operation to complete.  The observation was made that more than one job could be read into memory, allowing the processor to switch back and forth between jobs (or processes, as they came to be known).  While one process was involved in I/O, another could be running - i.e., making use of the processor.  The introduction of multiprogramming or multitasking laid the foundation for many features found in today???s operating systems.

As the price of machines came down and wages went up, the programmers??? and users??? time became an important commodity.  The importance of good response time and short turnaround time were factored into the OS design process.  The major step taken was the advent of time shared systems.  Instead of just submitting jobs, the user was given interactive access to the machine via a command line interface.  Since the processor speed was many orders of magnitude faster than the actions taken by the user, under ideal conditions the user could work as if she had sole access to the machine.


http://faculty.kutztown.edu/rieksts/343/notes/osdevpt.html


First, detailed instructions had to be written defining the problem and a procedure for solving it. These instructions were programmed by adjusting switches manually and inserting thousands of cables into as many as forty large plug boards. A team of five operators might work several days on the external wiring and many more days searching for errors and correcting them.???


???The switches and controls of ENIAC [which are] now arranged to be operated manually, can be positioned by mechanical relays and electromagnetic telephone switches which are instructed by a Teletype tape. [With this arrangement] tapes could be cut for many given problems and reused when needed???

It soon became apparent that much of the code written for each program was duplicated effort because it dealt with routine input and output procedures, such as reading input from a tape device, or sending output to the printer. Common program procedures were therefore developed to handle input and output via the standard I/O hardware devices. These "device drivers", as they became known, eliminated the need for programmers to write their own I/O routines, which meant that programs could be produced more efficiently.

The operating system, then, controls the operation of the computer. This includes determining which programs may use the processor at any given time, managing system resources such as working memory and secondary storage, and controlling access to input and output devices.

In the early days of computing, scheduling computing tasks was a problem because time on the computer had to be booked in advance, typically in half-hour blocks or multiples thereof. If the operator encountered problems and the program did not successfully run to completion in the allotted time, a new time slot had to be booked and the program would have to be run again from the beginning.

In some respects, the movement to three tier software architectures was a small step in the direction of loose coupling, at least at the level of standardizing interfaces across databases, application logic and presentation layers. In general, though, software has remained tightly coupled because of the inability of major vendors to agree on a universal set of standards to define interfaces across software modules.

Loosely coupled systems reduce this risk by enforcing standards for behavior at the interfaces of modules while providing a great deal of freedom to modify activity within the module. 
===  ===
A downside to modularity (and this depends on the extent of modularity) is that modular systems are not optimized for performance. This is usually due to the cost of putting up interfaces between modules.[citation needed]

The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces. This technique allows you to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether.

You could create a nice image server by modifying this:

(basically serve the images in a directory listing by serving the image)

Update: this isn't a single file despite what it claims.

when functional is better than declarative (or not)
I prefer jquery effects over css. It's easier to figure out when an effect isn't getting applied (though I guess that's because browsers ignore CSS errors rather than halt page execution so you are not forced to fix it)

=== Design ===
==== affordance ====
Follow a coherent conceptual model 
==== affordance ====
A .sh file AFFORDS running 
Whereas a .js file doesn't afford execution with the "node" command (nodejs)

so create a run.sh file with your node JS projects

==== Affordance: ====
Do not feed the anmials
Do not press this button

Piano keys - for a list of input buttons
piano key sound - feedback (e.g. when a button is pushed)
Lightbulbs - feedback (e.g. that the shift button is pushed)
water rippling - feedback (when something is dropped in it)
Shelf - for a bucket being filled with items
microswitch joystick - so you know when a small movement has been captured and you can stop
liquid flowing - when something is moved

box - asks to be filled
food - asks to be bitten
bottle cap - screwed on and off bottles

poor affordance
* digital volume control (plus and minus buttons with discrete levels)
* hovering to expand a menu

==== feedback ====
a car with a rattling engine tells you something unusual is happening
sound of a car warns against crossing the road (even more so for blind people)

lack of feedback
* LCD Screen buttons
* electronic traffic light pedestrian walkway button
* phonecall - being placed on hold

==== Visibility ====
Don Norman???s Usability Guidelines
* Visibility - By looking the user should be able to tell the state of the device

Lack of Visibility
* slideshows without progress meters
* terrestrial television - no on-screen display of show name
* CD players - only track number, no name

=== design ===
Long tail application design implications
Instead of creating a deep hierearchy you can collapse to fit on one page, concentrate on supporting search functionality to the more natural top-level
e.g. a concept map of all SCU courses. To find out what capstone cases I did, having to drill down from root -> management -> capstone -> case studies -> [intel, ibm...] is likely to be avoided because I don't consciously want to remind myself of my "management" lessons
It's better to have an infinite length list (e.g. a HTML page), only introducing nesting at the n-1 level (a bit like Mongo DB. You can do nesting but only when it's better than key-value search)

linux starts by running init
you tell it what the root file system is - e.g. /dev/sda1

busybox gives you basic linux commands
* ls
* sh

statically linked
* libraries - available on startup that are built-in to the binary
* take up memory
* this is a distro choice
* if you need network drivers for your root file system to be an NFS disk, the network driver needs to be statically linked.
dynamically linked
* files in the file system that are loaded on bootup

ko = kernel object
lsmod - show loaded modules

Bootloaders
* Grub

(Diagram Attached)

Imagine you are a little kid and you have a couple of siblings.

Your dad doesn't keep coins in his wallet - it's too bulky. So he deposits all his coins in a giant jar at home.

One day he asks you "Tell me how much money I have in 1 cent coins, in 5 cent coins...in $1 coins"

So you and your siblings each take a handful of coins out of the jar.

You stack all coins from your handful in different personal piles by value (all 1 cent coins in one pile, all 5 cent coins in one pile etc). Your friends do exactly the same thing, stacking their coins in their own personal piles.

Each of you adds up how much money he has in 1 cent coins, in 5 cent coins etc and go back to your dad with your totals.

He adds up the value of all your 1 cent coins put together, all of your 5 cent coins put together, ... all your 1$ coins put together.

==== Types of NoSQL databases ====
http://i4.minus.com/iglsBqPigJwkx.png
(source: http://www.marklogic.com/resources/nosql-selection-with-darwin-and-metcalf/resource_download/world13/)

Many software technologies sound so intimidatingly complicated. One way to overcome the complexity in your attempt to understand them is to find an equivalent that is functionally the same but on a more modest scale. Here are some examples:

Analogy to explain types of Databases:

* Relational Database = CSV file, log file
* Object Database = XML file
* Key-Value Database = Properties file
* Document Database = JSON file, Wikipedia markup text
* Graph Database = XML file with a fixed schema (i.e. a GraphML file)

Indians began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living the UK even in the earlier years. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. Later arrivals opened corner shops or ran post offices. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

20th century

Although post-war immigration was continuous, several distinct phases can be identified:
* workers were recruited to fulfill the labour shortage that resulted from World War II. These included Anglo-Indians who were recruited to work on the railways as they had done in India.
* Workers mainly from the Punjab and Gujarat regions arrived from India in the late 1950s and 1960s. Many worked in the foundries of the English Midlands. Large numbers of Gujaratis worked in the textile manufacturing sector in the northwest industrial towns of Blackburn, Dewsbury, Bolton, Lancaster, Manchester and Preston. Sikhs coming to London either migrated to the East to set up businesses where the wholesale, retail and manufacturing elements of the textile industry were located. Many Sikhs also moved to West London and took up employment at Heathrow airport and the associated industries and in the plants and factories of major brands such as Nestle around it.
* During the same time, medical staff from India were recruited for the newly formed National Health Service. These people were targeted as the British had established medical schools in the Indian subcontinent which conformed to the British standards of medical training.
* During the 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of East African Indians, predominantly Gujaratis but also sizeable numbers of Punjabis who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. Many of these people had been store-keepers and wholesale retailers in Africa and opened shops when they arrived in the UK.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian#20th_century

In the nine-year period between 2001 and 2010, the number of Indian-born people in the UK has increased in size by 43% from 467,634 to around 669,000 (an increase of over 200,000).[12]

20th century South Asian Immigration to Brazil

* The first wave of Indian immigration to Brazil began when a small number of Sindhis had arrived there from Suriname and Central America (mainly from Belize and Panama) in the 1960s to set up shop as traders in the city of Manaus.
* The second wave of immigration consisted of university professors to Rio de Janeiro from Bengaluru, Goa and Delhi who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s.
* Other people of Indian Origin migrated to that country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially Mozambique), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_immigration_to_Brazil
====   ====
According to the 2010 United States Census,[15] the Asian Indian population in the United States grew from almost 1,678,765 in 2000 (0.6% of U.S. population) to 2,843,391 in 2010 (0.9% of U.S. population), a growth rate of 69.37%, one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, although it is still one of the smallest communities in the US, not even completely one percent.[16][17][18][19]

===  ===
The first major wave of migration, albeit forced, was the mass importation of slaves, predominantly from Africa, in the time period between America's founding and the early 19 century. Slave importation was banned in 1808, ostensibly ending this mass migration. African migrants' early and tragically immoral introduction to the United States has plagued America’s conscience arguably more than any other historical event. Their presence resulted in seminal legislation and legal decisions, most notably in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, all of which have helped define American identity.

The second mass influx of individuals from foreign countries into the United States was the result of famine, revolution, and the emergence of industrialization. These three realities combined resulting in numerous Irish, German, and other European immigrants flooding into the United States just a decade and a half before America's own civil war. Though roughly 40 years before the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, the world's tired and poor sought refuge in the new, promising land of America. This huge influx renewed the European heritage of young America such that until the 1970s, the majority of naturalized citizens in America were born in Europe. The shear volume of immigrants during this period also created much of the impetus behind expanding and honing the quota system still at the heart of much American immigration debate.

The third major wave of American immigration came in the form of laborers from Central and South America. This wave has prompted intense debate across the political spectrum that reaches every policy sphere. The breadth of this spectrum of opinions has exhibited everything from xenophobia to policy opinions that raise substantial security concerns. Regardless of one's opinion on the massive population of Hispanic individuals currently residing in the United States, it is important to understand this population's historical relationship with America. In 1848, the U.S. signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which incorporated 80,000 Mexicans into the United States without their consent overnight. The geographic proximity to Central America, coupled with the massive and porous Southern border, contribute to the overwhelmingly large migration of Hispanic laborers.

==== Third Wave of Irish Immigration ====


Poor Irish in Dublin in 1920s
Centuries-old problems continued to plague Ireland in the early 20th century as a majority of its people lived and died with agriculture.  As agricultural exports sagged, many young Irishmen flocked to the cities for work, but low industrial wages and the condition of urban slums made life unbearable.  In the 1920s, over 20% of the Irish urban population lived in inadequate, overcrowded housing.

Facing little opportunity on the farms and squalid conditions in the cities, the young people of Ireland continued their mass exodus to other lands of opportunity.  For most Irish emigrants, departure for America would be preceded by a gathering of friends and family.  It was called the American wake, because so often those left behind would be saying their final goodbyes.

Nowhere was the influence of the Irish immigrant more pronounced than in America's most powerful city, New York.  75% of the famine Irish landed in New York harbor, and by 1860 a quarter of New York City's population was Irish.

Some examples of nations without a primate city would include India, with the six main cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Chennai; Canada, whose capital city, Ottawa, is overshadowed by the larger global cities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver; Brazil, whose capital and political center, Brasilia, is dwarfed in size and culture by São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte; Italy, whose political seat at Rome is balanced by its business, financial, and fashion "capital" of Milan; Australia, which has the two main cities of Sydney and Melbourne, while the political centre resides in the smaller city of Canberra; South Africa, with three official capitals in Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein, each housing a different branch of government, and whose main commercial centre is yet another city, Johannesburg; and the United States, whose financial and cultural centers are widely dispersed throughout the country in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago and whose political center is located in Washington, D.C. Germany is unique, in that the Berlin political center is somewhat weak. Several major government institutions are spread throughout the country, in cities like Bonn (the former capital) and Karlsruhe (seat of the federal constitutional court). Likewise, Frankfurt is its most important financial centre, but has significant competition from Düsseldorf and Munich. Germany's cultural center is split between Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dresden, and smaller cities. However, Berlin was considered a primate city of Germany in the years 1871-1945. In Turkey, the historical, cultural, financial, business and transportation center Istanbul is more than twice as large as the second-largest city Ankara, but Ankara is the political capital. Additionally, Mumbai, São Paulo, Ho Chi Minh City, Sydney, and Berlin have close competitors as their countries' largest cities (Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Hanoi, Melbourne, and Hamburg respectively).

Help understanding the difference btw Saxon, Norman, Celtic, Gallic, English



The best thing you can do to sort out the confusion is read the early chapters of 1066 and all that :-)

Bare essentials (I'm sure more knowledgeable people will leap in with more detail):

Celts, broadly speaking, were the people living in the British Isles at the time of the Roman conquest. They spoke languages that were the ancestors of modern Breton, Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Irish. 

Saxons (and their neighbours the Angles and Jutes) started arriving in the British Isles from about the 5th century AD. They came from what is now Denmark, North Germany and Friesland, though they probably lived further East before that. They spoke Germanic languages. These languages (usually lumped together as "Old English" or "Anglo-Saxon") became dominant in most of England and southern Scotland, while Cornwall, Ireland, Wales and northern Scotland remained largely Celtic-speaking.

Gallic is a tricky word: the Romans called most of north-western Europe "Gallia", so it gets used in several different ways, generally to refer to people or languages of Celtic origin. Nowadays, we tend to use "Gaelic" (pr. "gallic") for the Celtic languages of Scotland and Ireland; and "Gauls" for the Celtic people living in France during Roman times. 

Franks were Germanic people who became dominant in most of NW Europe around the 6th century. They originally spoke a Germanic language, but those living in what is now France later became French-speaking. Clovis and Charlemagne were Franks. Confusingly, Muslims in the medieval period tended to refer to all Western Christians as Franks.

Normans were from Normandy, in northern France. They seem to have been a mixture of local people (Franks/Gauls/whatever) with Vikings who came there from Norway around the ninth century. They spoke a dialect of French (a Romance language). Normans later spread to England (1066!), South Wales, Ireland, Sicily, and quite a few other places, taking their language with them.

Mercia was one of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England - at its greatest extent it stretched from the Thames and Severn to the Ribble and Humber. Offa was the most famous Mercian king.

The term English tends to be used (more-or-less) for the period after the Norman conquest (1066), when England became a single political unit. The English were a mixture of Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Danes, and Normans. Anglo-Saxon gradually merged with Norman French to become a language called "Middle English" (Chaucer, etc.), and that evolved into modern English.

Indians look for social approval above material wealth I guess die to history

Eg they'll enroll their child in piano classes. But why not a digital keyboard instead? Because the parents dream of performing, not of music composition which has no audience.

=== ===

San Francisco is a sophisticated city that celebrates the very best of creative cuisine. We are blessed with some of the best local, sustainably-farmed ingredients in the country. Dining out is art and entertainment here, and we make celebrities out of the chefs who give us both. And we are also a closely-knit community that takes care of its own local independent entrepreneurs.

Put that all together, and it means we hate chains here - especially those that serve really bad food. Go find a terrific little independent boulangerie in your neighborhood that makes really delicious pastries, and you will never be able to eat a Dunkin' Donut again.

The phone data is then attached to the scope ($scope) that was injected into our controller function. The controller scope is a prototypical descendant of the root scope that was created when the application bootstrapped
=== Approval, behavior ===
The concept of "good" grades and "good behavior" is largely based on the basic emotional need of a child for approval. The approval seeking drive within each of us. A child knows that if he doesn't have the approval of the "big people" around him, he could die. They could reject him and abandon him if they disapproved of him enough.

=== code reading ===
In Angular, the view is a projection of the model through the HTML template. 

==== Look for the repeatable element ====
The following looks daunting:
 angular.module('phonecat', []).
   config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
   $routeProvider.
       when('/phones', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-list.html',   controller: PhoneListCtrl}).
       when('/phones/:phoneId', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-detail.html', controller: PhoneDetailCtrl}).
       otherwise({redirectTo: '/phones'});
 }]);

until you imagine that dozens more routes being added:

 angular.module('phonecat', []).
   config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
   $routeProvider.
       when('/phones', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-list.html',   controller: PhoneListCtrl}).
       when('/phones/:phoneId', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-detail.html', controller: PhoneDetailCtrl}).
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       otherwise({redirectTo: '/phones'});
 }]);

Now it's obvious that the intent of this code block is to specify all url routes. The other code can to some extent be ignored. Same with hello world in java (public static main etc. is boilerplate that you can ignore initially)

Make the structure (i.e. table of contents) catered to people whose state of knowledge is in its infancy - and as a result want to read what you've written (i.e. they do not have the curse of knowledge)
e.g. You don't write a tourist guide for the Niagara falls as "Erosion effects" - even if that content is included. It should be "how the falls were formed". You're not writing it for a geography teacher grading you. You're writing it for the traveller.



=== Timeless classic songs ===

My wife and I got remarried. Our divorce didn't work out.

I made a killing in the stock market. I shot my broker.

There were three kids in my family. One of each sex.

If you have your life to live over again, don't do it.

Someday you'll go to far, and I hope you'll stay there.

When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading.

I once wanted to become an atheist, but I gave up - they have no holidays.

My dad was the town drunk. Most of the time that???s not so bad; but New York City?

I???ve been in love with the same woman for forty-one years. If my wife finds out, she???ll kill me.

Just got back from a pleasure trip: I took my mother-in-law to the airport.

My grandmother is over eighty and still doesn???t need glasses. Drinks right out of the bottle.

The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret.




=== File Systems ===
File system features you introduce will always have to be backward compatible. You cannot remove them later because people will have created files with them.

=== Interrupts ===

Interrupts are non-deterministic events

* '''top half''' - immediate. hard IRQ. hardware? Synchronous.
* '''bottom half''' - deferred. soft IRQ. software? Asynchronous.
** This deferred processing pattern is common in large scale software development
** Aggregated - because many such requests may come in


==== Clock ====
* CPU clock works by getting a timer interrupt
** specified by number of Hertz (named after a German scientist)
* timer interrupts are needed to count the amount of time a process has been using the CPU
* interrupts occur in between assembly instructions

==== Reentrant/Preemptive Kernel ====
* 2.6.32 - huge change in Linux kernel. It was made renetrant
* before kernel 2.6, a process's time slice had to expire. 2.6 onwards allowed pre-emption even if the time slice allocated at the time of scheduling hadn't expired
* Toward 2.6.x series of the Linux kernel, an ability to interrupt a task executing kernel code was added, although with that not all sections of the kernel code can be preempted

pre-emption - process switch

without pre-emption, a while(true) as a real-time process would hang the system

=== Memory ===

* Effective/Virtual Address - set at compile time and doesn't change between executions.
* '''Linear Address'''
** The least significant 12 bits (offset) are the same as for the physical address
* Physical Address


==== Page Table ====
* The page table is a bitmap
* CR3 is physical. There's no way to map it to anything virtual, since it IS the map
* each process has its own page table (so the process knows its CR3 value)


buddy allocator - allocates contiguous pages of memory

==== Translation Lookaside Buffer ====
* TLB caches the results of address translation
* TLB is a non-coherent structure (it may something is valid when it isn't) - because it's not tied to memory
* The TLB is basically a cache of the page directory within the processor (reducing access time by 10 times). Walking the page directory (which resides in main memory) is expensive.



=== Processes ===


The entire kernel must be in memory.

Program vs process (task)
* A process is a program in execution
* The '''loader''' decides what the relocated address will be
* Program is stored in ELF - Executable Loadable Format
* A process and a thread, in Linux, are no different when it comes to CPU time.
* When context switching, you're changing the task_struct

real time processes have their process's first bit set to 1 (so it's quick to look up)



=== Signals ===
Signals are like chords you can pull on a process

Killing a process
* There is no SIGKILL handler in a program because the kernel takes care of that
* Killing a process won't cause its children to be killed. They get reparented.

=== Synchronization ===



spin lock does a busy-wait (unlike mutex/semaphores)

* '''semaphore''' - counting resources
* '''mutex''' is a degenerate case for a semaphore (0 or 1)

You only return failure when the semaphore is available again because it will waste CPU cycles (if you returned failure before sleeping then we're effectively busy waiting)

When there are multiple processors, the other ones must busy-wait rather than sleep wait (via a semaphore)


=== System Calls ===
* '''call''' - takes you to a more privileged level
* '''return''' - takes you to a less privileged level

Linker and loader set the address of function calls (compiler)

before jumping to a specific routine, the sys_call wrapper needs to save all the registers

2. A FATHER'S ADVICE
 
Today, my father told me, “Just go for it and give it a try!  You don’t have to be a professional to build a successful product.  Amateurs started Google and Apple.  Professionals built the Titanic
 
3. The POWER of UNIQUENESS .
 
Today, I asked my mentor – a very successful business man in his 70’s – what his top 3 tips are for success.  He smiled and said, “Read something no one else is reading, think something no one else is thinking, and do something no one else is doing.
 
4. LOOKING BACK
 
Today, I interviewed my grandmother for part of a research paper I’m working on for my Psychology class.  When I asked her to define success in her own words, she said, “Success is when you look back at your life and the memories make you smile.

7. LOOKING BACK
 
Today, as my father, three brothers, and two sisters stood around my mother’s hospital bed, my mother uttered her last coherent words before she died. She simply said, “I feel so loved right now. We should have gotten together like this more often.”
 
8. AFFECTION
 
Today, I kissed my dad on the forehead as he passed away in a small hospital bed.  About 5 seconds after he passed, I realized it was the first time I had given him a kiss since I was a little boy.

Envisioning your goal = not quitting prematurely (like mom would)

===  ===
Once there was a man who did not make it to university. His mother got him married. After the marriage, he worked as a teacher in a primary school. Due to the lack of experience, he was squashed by the students in less than a week.

When he returned home, his wife dried his tears. She comforted him with these words. 'You should not be too sad about it. Probably there is a more suitable job waiting for you out there.'

Later on, he found another job and before long he was fired due to his slowness. This time, the wife commented. 'There are always people who are skilful and non skilful. Some have experience from their years of work. As for you, you were in school all this while. So, how could you acquire these needed skills?'

He went for a number of jobs but never stayed long in those jobs. Each time, he would return home with a dejected spirit. His wife would always comfort him and never once was she disappointed or resentful.

He was in his thirties when he acquired a flair in languages. He became a counselor in a school for the deaf and mute. Later on, he opened a school for the disabled. A few years later, he set up chain stores in different cities and provinces selling apparatus & equipment for the disabled. He became a multi-millionaire.

One day he asked his wife. 'When I was looking bleakly at my own future, what's the reason that you had so much faith in me?'

His wife gave him a very simple reply. She said, 

'When a piece of land is not suitable for planting wheat, we could try planting beans. If the beans are not growing well, we could try planting fruits or gourds. If the vegetation is not economical, we can instead scatter buckwheat seeds. These seeds will one day bloom into flowers. On this land itself, there will be one seed that will germinate and grow.'

After listening to his wife's explanation, he cried. His wife's faith, love, patience, and persistence is likened to the one seed in the land. This is the seed that persists and creates the miracle on this piece of land.

"In this world, there's no person who is useless. It is just that they have not positioned themselves firmly in the right place"

Pandora's box vin dicarlo 3 questions real or a fake scam?

Best Answer:  scam. i don't know how old you are, but you may be the lucky one. it doesn't make any difference if you are bad with girls. today's kids rush into things too fast as it is. take your time. female friends cannot be found in a meat market. you will see a lot of girls that aren't interested in you . that is part of life. but there are other girlS that will be interested in you. after meetimng a girl for the irst time, ask her about her favorite things, hobbies, music preferrences, things like that. once you get past the awkward stage of meeting, let things build slowly . then learn from each person you meet. enjoy

 Unlike the great majority of self-help books, this one looks like the classics: it stays short, and doesn't lose its point in a plethora of unnecessary case studies, examples, and narcissistic autobiographical reflections. Leonard stays focused, doesn't waste his readers' time,

Quality
???Quality cannot be tested in??? is so clich?? it has to be true. From automobiles to software if it isn???t built right in the first place then it is never going to be right. Ask any car company that has ever had to do a mass recall how expensive it is to bolt on quality after-the-fact.

It's okay to manipulate perception even if it's unethical. Because others will have unfair perceptions of you if you don't. It's defensive, not to gain an unfair advantage. It's to prevent an unfair disadvantage.

Domestic cats with homes have a child-parent relationship with their human companions. Result is that they never grow-up and remain kittenish:  friendly and playful. There is more to it than this though. My own cats have often  resented my leaving the house for even a few hours and spent a large part of their waking hours interacting with me. This varies between breeds and individual cats??? also cats that are lavished love and attention by their owners can become extremely responsive and loyal companions.

When a new cat is introduced into a household, squabbles often occur while the interloper tries to establish his or her own territory. Boundaries must be reestablished by the resident cats. Furthermore, when an established resident cat dies, his or her territory is usually inherited by the cat next in the hierarchical line.

Pamela Anderson is doing an ad for Verizon Wireless. They're promoting some new gizmo that lets you watch  "clips from your favorite TV shows" on your cell phone. Pam breathlessly tells the audience that now, thanks to the folks at Verizon, we can watch clips of her in Stacked on our cell phones! WTF?

And then she scolds us for looking at it ("eyes up here!").

Dream that could become a great TV series (drama, crime, thriller)

episode 1 - The outdoor wedding

Tom Noble and Tom Coles' are murdered by a black teenager using a baseball bat or gun in what seems like a violent crime after being enticed through a water bottle in the face at the end of a congregation service.  It turns out that it was to avenge the death of his older brother many years earlier in which these 2 are involved.

in a way i don't remember, and older black man calls the police with a fake name before getting involved in a traffic accident as a result of the call.

episode 2 Arms Park

the man and a female accomplice are drowning in a flood on an elderly couple's doorstep . the elderly man drown in trying to save them while the wife survives. (though there is a teaser that due to some floating vessel the three survive but are not heard from again so far.

The survivor and a couple of others escape through the back door on the run from the police along with the black teenager (again I don't remember the relationship between them). They successfully elude the police in some kind of dock facility. The lady returns to her home. 

episode 3

Many years pass. There is a fat black man who is a truck driver and has established a friendship with the Kudari family due to his regular service to them. He's good at climbing huge furniture which the Kudaris have a lot of. He is in possession of a gun and uses the family to avoid police detectives.

I didn't reach the stage yet, but the Kudari family members lives are endangered.

The fat black man is supposed to be a villain but he is the character in focus that is compelling to viewers because of his values underneath his criminal defence.

this book is not, as I had expected, a book about psychology to help compulsive shoppers gain insight into and control over their urge. Instead it is another book written for retail business marketers on examples of how consumers are bonded to brands. And there are many such boosk.

It's not a groundbreaking book on branding either

I was bored of my surroundings in the UK. The same service stations each time. Going on holiday was refreshing but undermined by the exhaustion and the need for improvisation (e.g. not having clean clothes, forgetting to take slippers, having to go through another human being to go somewhere using a taxi - remember I am uncomfortable around people, the  inner city crowd and dinginess). What I wanted was to go to the USA and not be a tourist. Living in the Bay Area turned out to be the perfect  permanent vacation (saying to myself "I'm in the United States" like it hadn't sunk in) and while i didn't reach the point of boredom, 10 years of living in the Bay Area and visiting LA in 2014 planted the seeds for a need to go on a new permanent vacation.

The US, upon moving here permanently, truly was an undiscovered world and "starting a new life"

I'm sad you have to rush such a decision. I'm 30 and every now and then I still regret the university degree I had to decide on in year 11. That dictates your 

A-levels.

Business is much more useful than sciences (and I was always good at sciences).
(I'm simplifying for the sake of explanation, but anyway...)

There are basically 2 types of careers (excluding athletic): academia and professional.

[LIST]
[*]Professional studies (and applied sciences) are more useful if you want to land a "proper" job (doctor, lawyer, engineer, teacher, accounting, architect, 

journalism ...).
[*]Academia (arts, fundamental sciences and humanities) doesn't lead directly to many jobs. Only research or teaching that subject (biology, classical studies, 

history, philosophy, English, political science, physics...). 
[/LIST]

Okay, that's a simplification, people with a degree in English can work for national newspapers etc, but the career path is not so obvious.

So in response to my comment that business is more useful than sciences, that's the reason why. Professional studies lead to proper jobs, academic studies do not.

Some interesting personal notes though: 
1) arts degrees are great for growing as a person. But since money is limited for attending college you have to worry about your career first and foremost
2) I took maths, further maths, chemistry and physics at A-level and am now a computer programmer. But combined those A-levels barely helped me at all. I actually 

found Latin and English the most useful for being a programmer (and I was terrible in English).
3) University admissions committees require certain A-level subjects for their degree, but that doesn't mean you need the content of those subjects actually 

matters. And when it comes to getting a job, having ANY degree is 80% of the challenge overcome (it gives you credibility). The actual degree you take may matter a 

lot less because you learn 'on the job'. I emphasize that's personal experience - you don't want to be a surgeon and not know how a heart works :|

BTW, I seriously recommend you have a look at this page. I wish I knew about this at age 16:

Negative into positive

Leaders often exhibit the wounds from their early losses and have a tenacity, 
even a ruthlessness, that may prove difficult for others to comprehend.
It is said that famous men are usually the product of unhappy childhood. The stern compression of circumstances, the twinges of adversity, the spur of slights and 
Tought conditions, weakness, jibes, cause very strong self motivational background and skills, which are the nature of being successful."

Dependency graphs provide a visual way for you to examine code and understand its dependencies without having to look through files and lines of code. You can see items and relationships as just nodes and links, or arrows. For example, suppose you have a code review to perform. You have a set of files that contain pending changes. You can visualize the code and dependencies for those changes by creating a dependency graph from those files. See Visualize specific dependencies in your solution.

logic pro more for music creation than final editing (which Pro Tools is for)
Though both can do either

rotary control  (round volume control) vs fader  (lateral volume control)

ATARI for a long time was the best MIDI solution

Apple acquired Emagic (that makes Logic Pro) for the AMS technology, not for Logic - it's not that profitable

MIDI port - same port as the PS/2 predecessor
* useful for connecting to older, but higher quality synthesizer that isn't computer-ready

sloppy disk (!)

midi track (sheet music) vs instrument track (synthesizes music)
computers didn't always have the processing power to generate real sound. You had to feed it out to a hardware keyboard and the output sound feeds it back in. Having a dedicated device is still preferred sometimes 

====   ====
Xpand interface - more lightweight than full virtual instruments but lower quality (like jpg and mp3)

quantize. Useful but for professionals it sounds too computerized and not natural enough

velocity = speed that a key is pressed (so really it's amplitude)

Event = note (more or less)

semitone - c to c#

transpose = change a note to another note

boom drum

midi track vs instrument track

One of the  primary roles of a drummer is to keep everyone else in sync. His role is perceived as "easy" because he doesn't have to deal with notes (to the point of there being well known drummer jokes)

You can't judge energy of a track the way you can amplitude, pitch etc.

live concerts are bands' R & D.

Recording audio from midi is usually done to save CPU load from synthesing. Otherwise there's no need.
It's like source code just in time compilation vs compilation.

In addition to making the characters significant to each other’s story lines, try weaving the plots together so they come to a head at the climax of your story. Maybe the resolution to one plot leads directly to the climax of another plot, or all of the plots meet at one point and suddenly your reader is hit with the significance of everything that has happened in the previous 200-500 pages.

If all you do is reproduce the conditions of that meeting with mechanical accuracy, dressing the actors and choosing the spot for shooting with documentary precision, you still won't achieve the same sensation from the film sequence as you had from the meeting itself. For when you filmed the scene of the meeting you ignored the psychological factor, your own mental state which caused the stranger's look to affect you with that particular emotion. And so for the stranger's look to startle the audience as it did you at the time, you have to prepare for it by building up a mood similar to your own at the moment of the actual meeting.

Episodes are so to speak propped up with a musical accompaniment which reiterates the main theme in order to heighten its emotional resonance

music does more than intensify the impression of the visual image by providing a parallel illustration of the same idea;

Music can be used to produce a necessary distortion of the visual material in the audience's perception, to make it heavier or lighter, more transparent, subtler, or, on the contrary, coarser... By using music, it is possible for the director to prompt the emotions of the audience in a particular direction, by widening the range of their perception of the visual image. The meaning of the object is not changed, but the object itself takes on a new colouring. The audience sees it (or at least, is given the opportunity of seeing it) as part of a new entity, to which the music is integral. 

I have to say that in my heart of hearts I don't believe films need music at all

The plot is what forms a memory in the readers’ mind, allowing them to think about the book and even making them want to read it again

In other words - a story can mislead from reality (selection bias) if it gets the viewer to remember it and come back for more.

Multi strand plotlines

Some stories work fine with a single hero pursuing one goal, but occasionally, a story will get boring in the middle, especially if there isn't enough conflict to sustain it.

The second plotline is intertwined with the first one. Both plotlines affect each other. Otherwise, the story would fragment into two separate stories and it would fall apart.

To keep the story alive, the writer simply jumps between storylines at the height of action, so the audience is constantly engaged.

So, when using multiple plotlines in your stories, make sure that they affect each other in some way,

At the end of the story, bring everything together. End each plotline one at a time or all at once.

After these questions have been answered and you have created a way to drive that theme home for your readers with a shocking or unnerving ending, you can then determine the best and most representative characters to complete those events or make those revelations. This is usually much easier to do than the aforementioned first step, because now, you have a thematic focus to work on and a solid base plot point (the conclusion) to build upon. Finding a character (or characters) to populate that plot is usually only a matter of looking for archetypes that fit your theme.

Styles have changed, and butt kicking is no longer a surefire laugh, except with children, who still find it hilarious.

=== ===

why building anticipation through foreshadowing leads to satisfaction with a viewer

You are teased getting something desirable and experience part of the pleasure, then are made to wait for it, then finally you are given it.

But it only works if it is desirable to begin with.

e.g. Hogan vs Warrior teased at Royal Rumble 1990. people started getting an idea how epic it would be if the 2 battled to see who is the supreme force

In Atletico documentary, Atletico should momentarily experience something desirable but then have it taken away from them (e.g. promotion)

Give half the ingredients
Malaga shot in injury time to win the league
Correa almost seals promotion

video editing
use symbolic events that reinforce the story you're trying to tell. e.g. Man Utd comeback with 10 men to 3-3 in the 80s was a sign of shifting power even though reality was much less convenient.
=== ===
Story cuts through the clutter and strips things down to what matters most. Story says, ???look here??? focus on this.???

=== ===

documentary making

Merge related things into 1 segment even if they are out of chronological order

even if the timelines aren't quite right, put related things together
* e.g. WWE Divas gone Wild - put Sunny = 1996, Chyna = 1997, Sable = 1998
Sable was there until 1996 (before Chyna) but they only begin talking about her a after they've talked about Chyna who debut in 1997.
They shifted anything Sable related to the period when her most famous contributions came.

=== how not to create a documentary ===

Have no change. Everything is in steady state
* e.g. A video with a list of places you encounter the golden ratio, with one section for human body, another for astronomy, etc. This got boring after 2 chapters

Most films will also include selective use of other transitions, usually to convey a tone or mood, suggest the passage of time, or separate parts of the stor
===  ===
When to Use the Dissolve

This is the second most common transition used in motion pictures, and, unlike most straight cuts, it attracts attention to itself on purpose. 

The dissolve is most often used where:
-There is a change in time
-There is a change in location
-Time needs to be slowed down or sped up
-There is an emotional component to the subject in the story
-There is a strong visual relationship between the outgoing and the incoming images

Composition – The two shots dissolving together should each have compositions that overlap easily and avoid a visual “mess” – particularly at the midpoint when both images are, typically, at 50% opacity. You may dissolve opposing compositional frames (shot one has its subject frame left while shot two has its subject frame right) to unify the images in one, momentary yet well-balanced dissolving frame.

It is important to note that dissolves can also slow down time and manipulate the emotions of an audience when accompanied by slow motion imagery. A romantic or maybe an emotionally sad sequence can use dissolves rather effectively to slow down events and give the audience time to view and digest the meaning of the material.
===  ===

Wipes are a good way to show changing location.

Crossfades can also convey a sense of passing time or changing location.
Dissolves can better convey a sense of passing time than a cut.

Effective integration of transitions should always be inspired by some aspect of the story that is being conveyed in your video. For example, a transition may signify a change in location, or a change in the pace of the action, or simply the passage of time.  If there’s no specific reason to use a transition, keep it simple and use a cut.

Lighten up buddy. You'll enjoy WWE a lot more if you don't take it so seriously and just love it for what it is. I started watching WWF in 1992 and if it wasn't for the fact I didn't know that it sucked back then too I'd have never got any enjoyment and become a fan in the first place. WWE is a cartoon that both kids and adults can enjoy at different depths, just like Disney.

I stopped watching after WM 15 through to just after WM 21. The "easy to explain reason" is that I moved out of my UK home and it was not possible to get access to Sky TV living at school/college housing. But I had hung on for a few years prior to that despite that handicap. The real reason was that as the attitude era took off and it expanded to 2 hours and became what the "cool" kids at school liked I just got less and less attached to the product. It was too much content to keep up with (I ran through so much VHS tape and shelf space).

Vince McMahon quotes

Vincent K McMahon:

"Despite the way I would feel personally about someone, if it's the right business thing to do, I'll do it for our audience."

"Giving it to the audience is probably the easiest thing. Finding out what they truly want is probably the most difficult."

"If you stop building stars, which we never do, you wouldn't be in business."

"We love our fans, so there's nothing we wouldn't do for them, and we go directly to them."

"Again, the nice part about it is that we listen to our fans, and they're the ones who really decide who is ready to break through into that top echelon."

Whenever I heard the word "charisma" I picture his face and bleach blonde locks.

Does anyone know what his last public appearance was? (I know he didn't die purely from natural health deterioration but it would be insightful to see what he last looked like).

Of the 50 or so wrestlers I've met in the last 6 years, not one had passed away, not even Jake Roberts. This is an unfortunate (but inevitable) first. No matter how many people die, it's something we never get used to and desensitized from. That's the downside of every human being unique and irreplaceable.

I wish he could have made it to his 70th birthday. Somehow 70 is symbolically okay to die after, but 69 still feels just a bit too soon.

I had been dying to ask Dusty "how do you come up with your catchphrases" and I don't remember much about what he said but he did say from things like billboards. I'm glad I got to ask him that a mere 3 months ago, even if I'm no more capable of coming up with them now than I was before asking him ;)

Wrestling humor

Mrs Fandango

Joel Gertner: "It is I, the bacon in her eggs. The man for whom she begs and the face between her legs...the lyrical miracle, the sexual intellectual and the quintessential studmuffin, Joel 'Lady Gaga advocates celibacy...what an absolute disgrace...if she won't let me stuff her muff then I'll just poke her face' Gertner"

Joel Gertner: 'Why go to the movies when you can stay home and see me, the one the ladies call Big Daddy, the one who already slept with the Generals Daughter and the one who truly knows how to Inspect-her Gadget, I am dripping with sarcasm, as your girlfriend is dripping from orgasm, for I am the Quintessential Studmuffin and a goodness gracious, great balls of fire God damn handsome man, Joel 'Whether the ladies are home or here in Daten(sp?), they're watching me and masturbating' Gertner'

WWE life lessons

People will not be loyal and return favours when they have a chance to get ahead.
* Seth Rollins turning his back on Shield to join authority.
=== ===
becoming popular with a WWE audience
crowds are attracted to people with confidence. I see it time and time again. People who don't second guess whatever controversial things they're doing.
e.g. Kevin Owens standing toe to toe with Cena like he belongs
New Day turning heel and just enjoying themselves regardless of what the crowd think, almost spoofing themselves

Lawler

new day: not only does Seth Rollins have your (Orton's) number, but he has it on speed dial

Wrestling humor

Gorilla Mansoon: Hello everyone welcome to all American wrestling, I'm Vince McMahon.

why WWE shortens names to 1 word
To prevent half imitaion by rival promotions
e.g. Alberto El Patrone
Mr Anderson


=== ===
and bring the United States title back to where it belongs


My mother in law could barely speak English and I can't speak Indian but now every week 


Don't automate too soon. So by the same analogy, I believe you should not use a framework if you can use old embedded servers, Jdbc, json etc

=== ===
the genius of hulk hogan image protection

saying he has one more match in him even if he doesn't (keeping his name relevant)

saying he'd induct the Ultimate Warrior into the HOF even if Warrior had said nasty things about him

not dropping the title to Bret Hart but did to Yokozuna who would not stay on top for long

Entering the outsiders/NWO

Storytelling

Austiin (from Triple H podcast): watching WWE is like the middle of a book. There is no beginning or end.
=== ===

Jeff Jarrett is an inspirational figure
He doesn't complain, he doesn't hold grudges, he doesn't waste time blaming or talking about others. He has a vision and is always talking about things to be done, rather than what is not good enough.

Not so much a question as a comment to tell you that WWE and technology can make a guy and his mother in law best friends. 

Every week she and I discuss the fallout of raw over mobile chat. 

She said just a few minutes ago please tell john Cena to beat rusev at wrestlemania 

=== ===

WWF superstars, challenge, prime time wretsling were essentially infomercials (that Vince payed for TV time for) to sell tickets for PPVs and house shows

 ???visitors to the IWC might be taken aback by the high volume of complaining, misspelled tweeting, bickering over things that don???t matter,
=== Fictional Character comparisons ===

=== Reputations in WWE ===

Big show - keeps turning and everyone has lost count how many times

Triple H - buries his own talent
R-Truth - forgets whether he's involved in tournaments
Lesnar - legitimately tough
Lawler - minimalist employee
Booker T - low wrestling commentary IQ
Michael Cole - yelled at in headset by Vince
Jim Ross - bullied by Vince
JBL - current events knowledge
Cesaro - Swiss :D
Kofi Kingston - Battle Royale spots

** Irish - hornswoggle
=== Making it in wrestling ===
to be determined to stick with something when it's hard you either have to:
* enjoy it even if you're not particularly good at it, or
* be good at it even if you don't enjoy it

e.g. in wrestling, a lot of wrestlers not (or no longer) working for WWE making no money to pay their bills but love wrestling (e.g. DH Smith, Chris Masters, John Morrison) OR Brock Lesnar who doesn't like the all-consuming lifestyle but is offered a lucrative contract because of his drawing power

I went to play my bagpipe. I was wearing the kilt from the band. The announcer didn’t know who I was. He just knew my first name was Roddy. So he said, ‘Here comes Roddy the Piper.'”

Okay, no such book exists but as a business school graduate I'm fascinated by the principles Vince has used over the decades to guide his business decisions. There are loads more but I never tried to remember them until now. Your contributions are welcome. Until Vince release his own book this might be the most authoritative literature in the public domain ;)

* Forgive and forget...if it's profitable
* Hype your products - even if they're not that good ("Pump and dump")
** Say how great the product was for those that didn't get it (non-buyer's remorse)
* Associate yourselves with mainstream celebrities to add credibility
* Attractive women draw both male and female viewers
* Masses cannot handle complexity. Make your product easy to understand ("lowest common denominator")
* Always use the name of your talent. Never bypass it by saying the pronoun. Each time you mention it, its brand equity increases.
* Be on the cutting edge of technology platforms
* Invest in high end production values
* Don't acknowledge your competition
* Try lots of things, keep what works (as said by Jim Collins)
* Lead by example
* Give your customers what they want, even if it undermines your self-dignity
* Aggressively counter your competition
* Superserve your market with more product than a customer can completely consume
