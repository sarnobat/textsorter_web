=== keyboard shortcuts recommended ===
These are not for built in shortcuts. They're for ones that you must configure yourself and would forget each time they get wiped, or get inconsistent ones

==== Command Line ====
* Alt-f : find
* Alt-g : pipe xargs grep
* Alt-p : pwd
* Alt-shift-d : dir stack
* Alt-l : list directory
* Alt-j : SSH connect
* ? Alt-m : mount all
* Alt-v : paste

==== Development environment (e.g. Eclipse) ====
* ? Ctrl-o : Open resource
* Ctrl-shift-w : Close All
* Ctrl-w : Close
* Close Others

==== Operating System Window Manager ====

focus via wmctrl

* Focus Development Environment
* Focus terminal

==== Tips ====
* shortcuts bound to Modified keys (alt-tab) cause more strain than unmodified ones (e.g F1)
* One idea for ordering F1 to F12 shortcuts is by:
** how much of your time the application is focussed 
** how far-reaching the application is network-wise
* The more often a command is required, the less buttons one should have to press

Is there a such thing as a set of standards for keyboard shortcuts? Maybe I should start one ;)
* There are but they aren't standardized for commands that are specialized or core to productivity



=== Meetup - Linux device drivers (13 Aug 2014) ===
Block device - aysnchronous
Character device - synchronous/blocking


drivers/char/mem.c

the struct containing fops_null is the implementation of /dev/null

ram file system - i.e. no backing store. But useful at boot time.

=== Neo4j evaluation (why I like Neo4j) - MASTER COPY, but an alternate version for Objy created ===

I'm talking (mostly) as a newbie developer who is learning to use the DB, not an enterprise architect trying to scale to hundreds of hits at a time.

* neo4j-shell FUSE-like file system (but FUSE would be better so you can use key bindings, command history search, tab completion, dir colors, find command to quickly print paths)
* Embedded mode (preferred initially because of type safety, targetted exception handling)
** https://github.com/sarnobat/neo4j_embedded/blob/master/test.groovy
** Pure java to get all nodes, without ever having to care about any query language (initially)
* Cypher - readable, handles all cases I care about
* Cypher over REST. Not restricted to pure REST GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests
* No need for strong types. It's just an extension of a java.util.Map
* Replication (though master-slave only; not free. Better than nothing - it's reassuring)


What I don't like:
* No remote java database connections like SQL (so non-rest java code must reside on server)
* Pure REST querying - can only do basic queries; output is bloated; no results without autoindexing (I don't want to learn about indexing yet - I still don't know what indexes are)
** REST Output is bloated - but done for discoverability (which in practice isn't that useful)
* Cypher - having to check a property exists before evaluating a predicate on it
* Transactions over REST not possible
* No introspection (I assume; but I've never tried it)
* No asynchronous transactions like Couchbase

=== What is an Operating system ===

Resource management - reduce slack time (that's the main reason for multitasking)



An I/O operation is orders of magnitude slower than instruction execution.  For this reason the processor would sit idle a large proportion of the time, despite the efficiency improvements brought about by batch systems.  Instead of doing useful work, the processor would wait for an I/O operation to complete.  The observation was made that more than one job could be read into memory, allowing the processor to switch back and forth between jobs (or processes, as they came to be known).  While one process was involved in I/O, another could be running - i.e., making use of the processor.  The introduction of multiprogramming or multitasking laid the foundation for many features found in today???s operating systems.

As the price of machines came down and wages went up, the programmers??? and users??? time became an important commodity.  The importance of good response time and short turnaround time were factored into the OS design process.  The major step taken was the advent of time shared systems.  Instead of just submitting jobs, the user was given interactive access to the machine via a command line interface.  Since the processor speed was many orders of magnitude faster than the actions taken by the user, under ideal conditions the user could work as if she had sole access to the machine.


http://faculty.kutztown.edu/rieksts/343/notes/osdevpt.html


First, detailed instructions had to be written defining the problem and a procedure for solving it. These instructions were programmed by adjusting switches manually and inserting thousands of cables into as many as forty large plug boards. A team of five operators might work several days on the external wiring and many more days searching for errors and correcting them.???


???The switches and controls of ENIAC [which are] now arranged to be operated manually, can be positioned by mechanical relays and electromagnetic telephone switches which are instructed by a Teletype tape. [With this arrangement] tapes could be cut for many given problems and reused when needed???

It soon became apparent that much of the code written for each program was duplicated effort because it dealt with routine input and output procedures, such as reading input from a tape device, or sending output to the printer. Common program procedures were therefore developed to handle input and output via the standard I/O hardware devices. These "device drivers", as they became known, eliminated the need for programmers to write their own I/O routines, which meant that programs could be produced more efficiently.

The operating system, then, controls the operation of the computer. This includes determining which programs may use the processor at any given time, managing system resources such as working memory and secondary storage, and controlling access to input and output devices.

In the early days of computing, scheduling computing tasks was a problem because time on the computer had to be booked in advance, typically in half-hour blocks or multiples thereof. If the operator encountered problems and the program did not successfully run to completion in the allotted time, a new time slot had to be booked and the program would have to be run again from the beginning.

In some respects, the movement to three tier software architectures was a small step in the direction of loose coupling, at least at the level of standardizing interfaces across databases, application logic and presentation layers. In general, though, software has remained tightly coupled because of the inability of major vendors to agree on a universal set of standards to define interfaces across software modules.

Loosely coupled systems reduce this risk by enforcing standards for behavior at the interfaces of modules while providing a great deal of freedom to modify activity within the module. 
===  ===
A downside to modularity (and this depends on the extent of modularity) is that modular systems are not optimized for performance. This is usually due to the cost of putting up interfaces between modules.[citation needed]

The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces. This technique allows you to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether.

A .sh file AFFORDS running 
Whereas a .js file doesn't afford execution with the "node" command (nodejs)

so create a run.sh file with your node JS projects

Lightbulbs - feedback (e.g. that the shift button is pushed)
water rippling - feedback (when something is dropped in it)
Shelf - for a bucket being filled with items
microswitch joystick - so you know when a small movement has been captured and you can stop
liquid flowing - when something is moved

Long tail application design implications
Instead of creating a deep hierearchy you can collapse to fit on one page, concentrate on supporting search functionality to the more natural top-level
e.g. a concept map of all SCU courses. To find out what capstone cases I did, having to drill down from root -> management -> capstone -> case studies -> [intel, ibm...] is likely to be avoided because I don't consciously want to remind myself of my "management" lessons
It's better to have an infinite length list (e.g. a HTML page), only introducing nesting at the n-1 level (a bit like Mongo DB. You can do nesting but only when it's better than key-value search)

linux starts by running init
you tell it what the root file system is - e.g. /dev/sda1

busybox gives you basic linux commands
* ls
* sh

statically linked
* libraries - available on startup that are built-in to the binary
* take up memory
* this is a distro choice
* if you need network drivers for your root file system to be an NFS disk, the network driver needs to be statically linked.
dynamically linked
* files in the file system that are loaded on bootup

ko = kernel object
lsmod - show loaded modules

(Diagram Attached)

Imagine you are a little kid and you have a couple of siblings.

Your dad doesn't keep coins in his wallet - it's too bulky. So he deposits all his coins in a giant jar at home.

One day he asks you "Tell me how much money I have in 1 cent coins, in 5 cent coins...in $1 coins"

So you and your siblings each take a handful of coins out of the jar.

You stack all coins from your handful in different personal piles by value (all 1 cent coins in one pile, all 5 cent coins in one pile etc). Your friends do exactly the same thing, stacking their coins in their own personal piles.

Each of you adds up how much money he has in 1 cent coins, in 5 cent coins etc and go back to your dad with your totals.

He adds up the value of all your 1 cent coins put together, all of your 5 cent coins put together, ... all your 1$ coins put together.

Many software technologies sound so intimidatingly complicated. One way to overcome the complexity in your attempt to understand them is to find an equivalent that is functionally the same but on a more modest scale. Here are some examples:

Analogy to explain types of Databases:

* Relational Database = CSV file, log file
* Object Database = XML file
* Key-Value Database = Properties file
* Document Database = JSON file, Wikipedia markup text
* Graph Database = XML file with a fixed schema (i.e. a GraphML file)

Indians began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living the UK even in the earlier years. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. Later arrivals opened corner shops or ran post offices. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom#Post-war_immigration_.281945.E2.80.931983.29

20th century

Although post-war immigration was continuous, several distinct phases can be identified:
* workers were recruited to fulfill the labour shortage that resulted from World War II. These included Anglo-Indians who were recruited to work on the railways as they had done in India.
* Workers mainly from the Punjab and Gujarat regions arrived from India in the late 1950s and 1960s. Many worked in the foundries of the English Midlands. Large numbers of Gujaratis worked in the textile manufacturing sector in the northwest industrial towns of Blackburn, Dewsbury, Bolton, Lancaster, Manchester and Preston. Sikhs coming to London either migrated to the East to set up businesses where the wholesale, retail and manufacturing elements of the textile industry were located. Many Sikhs also moved to West London and took up employment at Heathrow airport and the associated industries and in the plants and factories of major brands such as Nestle around it.
* During the same time, medical staff from India were recruited for the newly formed National Health Service. These people were targeted as the British had established medical schools in the Indian subcontinent which conformed to the British standards of medical training.
* During the 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of East African Indians, predominantly Gujaratis but also sizeable numbers of Punjabis who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. Many of these people had been store-keepers and wholesale retailers in Africa and opened shops when they arrived in the UK.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian#20th_century

In the nine-year period between 2001 and 2010, the number of Indian-born people in the UK has increased in size by 43% from 467,634 to around 669,000 (an increase of over 200,000).[12]

20th century South Asian Immigration to Brazil

* The first wave of Indian immigration to Brazil began when a small number of Sindhis had arrived there from Suriname and Central America (mainly from Belize and Panama) in the 1960s to set up shop as traders in the city of Manaus.
* The second wave of immigration consisted of university professors to Rio de Janeiro from Bengaluru, Goa and Delhi who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s.
* Other people of Indian Origin migrated to that country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially Mozambique), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_immigration_to_Brazil
====   ====
According to the 2010 United States Census,[15] the Asian Indian population in the United States grew from almost 1,678,765 in 2000 (0.6% of U.S. population) to 2,843,391 in 2010 (0.9% of U.S. population), a growth rate of 69.37%, one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, although it is still one of the smallest communities in the US, not even completely one percent.[16][17][18][19]

===  ===
The first major wave of migration, albeit forced, was the mass importation of slaves, predominantly from Africa, in the time period between America's founding and the early 19 century. Slave importation was banned in 1808, ostensibly ending this mass migration. African migrants' early and tragically immoral introduction to the United States has plagued America’s conscience arguably more than any other historical event. Their presence resulted in seminal legislation and legal decisions, most notably in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, all of which have helped define American identity.

The second mass influx of individuals from foreign countries into the United States was the result of famine, revolution, and the emergence of industrialization. These three realities combined resulting in numerous Irish, German, and other European immigrants flooding into the United States just a decade and a half before America's own civil war. Though roughly 40 years before the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, the world's tired and poor sought refuge in the new, promising land of America. This huge influx renewed the European heritage of young America such that until the 1970s, the majority of naturalized citizens in America were born in Europe. The shear volume of immigrants during this period also created much of the impetus behind expanding and honing the quota system still at the heart of much American immigration debate.

The third major wave of American immigration came in the form of laborers from Central and South America. This wave has prompted intense debate across the political spectrum that reaches every policy sphere. The breadth of this spectrum of opinions has exhibited everything from xenophobia to policy opinions that raise substantial security concerns. Regardless of one's opinion on the massive population of Hispanic individuals currently residing in the United States, it is important to understand this population's historical relationship with America. In 1848, the U.S. signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which incorporated 80,000 Mexicans into the United States without their consent overnight. The geographic proximity to Central America, coupled with the massive and porous Southern border, contribute to the overwhelmingly large migration of Hispanic laborers.

==== Third Wave of Irish Immigration ====


Poor Irish in Dublin in 1920s
Centuries-old problems continued to plague Ireland in the early 20th century as a majority of its people lived and died with agriculture.  As agricultural exports sagged, many young Irishmen flocked to the cities for work, but low industrial wages and the condition of urban slums made life unbearable.  In the 1920s, over 20% of the Irish urban population lived in inadequate, overcrowded housing.

Facing little opportunity on the farms and squalid conditions in the cities, the young people of Ireland continued their mass exodus to other lands of opportunity.  For most Irish emigrants, departure for America would be preceded by a gathering of friends and family.  It was called the American wake, because so often those left behind would be saying their final goodbyes.

Nowhere was the influence of the Irish immigrant more pronounced than in America's most powerful city, New York.  75% of the famine Irish landed in New York harbor, and by 1860 a quarter of New York City's population was Irish.

Why is bollywood so western obsessed ? There is absolutely nothing indian about this dance or video except the song. Where are the indian clothes? Indian steps? And its not just this song, most of the videos these days are the same. Is it "cool" to act/dress like a westerner in India? ???

Some examples of nations without a primate city would include India, with the six main cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Chennai; Canada, whose capital city, Ottawa, is overshadowed by the larger global cities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver; Brazil, whose capital and political center, Brasilia, is dwarfed in size and culture by São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte; Italy, whose political seat at Rome is balanced by its business, financial, and fashion "capital" of Milan; Australia, which has the two main cities of Sydney and Melbourne, while the political centre resides in the smaller city of Canberra; South Africa, with three official capitals in Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein, each housing a different branch of government, and whose main commercial centre is yet another city, Johannesburg; and the United States, whose financial and cultural centers are widely dispersed throughout the country in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago and whose political center is located in Washington, D.C. Germany is unique, in that the Berlin political center is somewhat weak. Several major government institutions are spread throughout the country, in cities like Bonn (the former capital) and Karlsruhe (seat of the federal constitutional court). Likewise, Frankfurt is its most important financial centre, but has significant competition from Düsseldorf and Munich. Germany's cultural center is split between Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dresden, and smaller cities. However, Berlin was considered a primate city of Germany in the years 1871-1945. In Turkey, the historical, cultural, financial, business and transportation center Istanbul is more than twice as large as the second-largest city Ankara, but Ankara is the political capital. Additionally, Mumbai, São Paulo, Ho Chi Minh City, Sydney, and Berlin have close competitors as their countries' largest cities (Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Hanoi, Melbourne, and Hamburg respectively).

Help understanding the difference btw Saxon, Norman, Celtic, Gallic, English



The best thing you can do to sort out the confusion is read the early chapters of 1066 and all that :-)

Bare essentials (I'm sure more knowledgeable people will leap in with more detail):

Celts, broadly speaking, were the people living in the British Isles at the time of the Roman conquest. They spoke languages that were the ancestors of modern Breton, Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Irish. 

Saxons (and their neighbours the Angles and Jutes) started arriving in the British Isles from about the 5th century AD. They came from what is now Denmark, North Germany and Friesland, though they probably lived further East before that. They spoke Germanic languages. These languages (usually lumped together as "Old English" or "Anglo-Saxon") became dominant in most of England and southern Scotland, while Cornwall, Ireland, Wales and northern Scotland remained largely Celtic-speaking.

Gallic is a tricky word: the Romans called most of north-western Europe "Gallia", so it gets used in several different ways, generally to refer to people or languages of Celtic origin. Nowadays, we tend to use "Gaelic" (pr. "gallic") for the Celtic languages of Scotland and Ireland; and "Gauls" for the Celtic people living in France during Roman times. 

Franks were Germanic people who became dominant in most of NW Europe around the 6th century. They originally spoke a Germanic language, but those living in what is now France later became French-speaking. Clovis and Charlemagne were Franks. Confusingly, Muslims in the medieval period tended to refer to all Western Christians as Franks.

Normans were from Normandy, in northern France. They seem to have been a mixture of local people (Franks/Gauls/whatever) with Vikings who came there from Norway around the ninth century. They spoke a dialect of French (a Romance language). Normans later spread to England (1066!), South Wales, Ireland, Sicily, and quite a few other places, taking their language with them.

Mercia was one of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England - at its greatest extent it stretched from the Thames and Severn to the Ribble and Humber. Offa was the most famous Mercian king.

The term English tends to be used (more-or-less) for the period after the Norman conquest (1066), when England became a single political unit. The English were a mixture of Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Danes, and Normans. Anglo-Saxon gradually merged with Norman French to become a language called "Middle English" (Chaucer, etc.), and that evolved into modern English.

Indians look for social approval above material wealth I guess die to history

Eg they'll enroll their child in piano classes. But why not a digital keyboard instead? Because the parents dream of performing, not of music composition which has no audience.

=== ===

San Francisco is a sophisticated city that celebrates the very best of creative cuisine. We are blessed with some of the best local, sustainably-farmed ingredients in the country. Dining out is art and entertainment here, and we make celebrities out of the chefs who give us both. And we are also a closely-knit community that takes care of its own local independent entrepreneurs.

Put that all together, and it means we hate chains here - especially those that serve really bad food. Go find a terrific little independent boulangerie in your neighborhood that makes really delicious pastries, and you will never be able to eat a Dunkin' Donut again.

The phone data is then attached to the scope ($scope) that was injected into our controller function. The controller scope is a prototypical descendant of the root scope that was created when the application bootstrapped
=== Approval, behavior ===
The concept of "good" grades and "good behavior" is largely based on the basic emotional need of a child for approval. The approval seeking drive within each of us. A child knows that if he doesn't have the approval of the "big people" around him, he could die. They could reject him and abandon him if they disapproved of him enough.

In Angular, the view is a projection of the model through the HTML template. 

==== Look for the repeatable element ====
The following looks daunting:
 angular.module('phonecat', []).
   config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
   $routeProvider.
       when('/phones', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-list.html',   controller: PhoneListCtrl}).
       when('/phones/:phoneId', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-detail.html', controller: PhoneDetailCtrl}).
       otherwise({redirectTo: '/phones'});
 }]);

until you imagine that dozens more routes being added:

 angular.module('phonecat', []).
   config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
   $routeProvider.
       when('/phones', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-list.html',   controller: PhoneListCtrl}).
       when('/phones/:phoneId', {templateUrl: 'partials/phone-detail.html', controller: PhoneDetailCtrl}).
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       when().
       otherwise({redirectTo: '/phones'});
 }]);

Now it's obvious that the intent of this code block is to specify all url routes. The other code can to some extent be ignored. Same with hello world in java (public static main etc. is boilerplate that you can ignore initially)

=== Original phrase ===

Don't make your class students monkeys without branches - give people a roadmap of the class session
(MGMT703 gave us no indication how the class would unfold and I felt the professor was just stalling for 40 minutes until I asked him are we going to have slides etc)

=== The key to good writing (for cheat sheets etc). ===

Make the structure (i.e. table of contents) catered to people whose state of knowledge is in its infancy - and as a result want to read what you've written (i.e. they do not have the curse of knowledge)
e.g. You don't write a tourist guide for the Niagara falls as "Erosion effects" - even if that content is included. It should be "how the falls were formed". You're not writing it for a geography teacher grading you. You're writing it for the traveller.



=== Timeless classic songs ===
nostalgia music cateogory = timeless classics

e.g. Walking on Sunshine
Empire State of Mind
=== To be come a classic ===
to become a timeless musical piece, it needs to represent something emotional (like a civilization)
* could represent a feeling like romance (e.g. Baby got back!)

== UCSC Kernel Architecture summary cheat sheet ==

 
* Small changes have big effects
* With ANY software, but especially the OS kernel, you need to understand the concepts
* Abstraction is not useful at a kernel development level.


* KAPI = kernel APIs (applications can call these; do not call anything else)
** https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-docs.txt
** https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/locking/spinlocks.txt


* Windows is Unix-based. They took a lot of code from there.

henny youngman

My wife and I got remarried. Our divorce didn't work out.

I made a killing in the stock market. I shot my broker.

There were three kids in my family. One of each sex.

If you have your life to live over again, don't do it.

Someday you'll go to far, and I hope you'll stay there.

When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading.

I once wanted to become an atheist, but I gave up - they have no holidays.

My dad was the town drunk. Most of the time that???s not so bad; but New York City?

I???ve been in love with the same woman for forty-one years. If my wife finds out, she???ll kill me.

Just got back from a pleasure trip: I took my mother-in-law to the airport.

My grandmother is over eighty and still doesn???t need glasses. Drinks right out of the bottle.

The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret.




=== File Systems ===
File system features you introduce will always have to be backward compatible. You cannot remove them later because people will have created files with them.

=== Interrupts ===

Interrupts are non-deterministic events

* '''top half''' - immediate. hard IRQ. hardware? Synchronous.
* '''bottom half''' - deferred. soft IRQ. software? Asynchronous.
** This deferred processing pattern is common in large scale software development
** Aggregated - because many such requests may come in


==== Clock ====
* CPU clock works by getting a timer interrupt
** specified by number of Hertz (named after a German scientist)
* timer interrupts are needed to count the amount of time a process has been using the CPU
* interrupts occur in between assembly instructions

==== Reentrant/Preemptive Kernel ====
* 2.6.32 - huge change in Linux kernel. It was made renetrant
* before kernel 2.6, a process's time slice had to expire. 2.6 onwards allowed pre-emption even if the time slice allocated at the time of scheduling hadn't expired
* Toward 2.6.x series of the Linux kernel, an ability to interrupt a task executing kernel code was added, although with that not all sections of the kernel code can be preempted

pre-emption - process switch

without pre-emption, a while(true) as a real-time process would hang the system

=== Memory ===

* Effective/Virtual Address - set at compile time and doesn't change between executions.
* '''Linear Address'''
** The least significant 12 bits (offset) are the same as for the physical address
* Physical Address


==== Page Table ====
* The page table is a bitmap
* CR3 is physical. There's no way to map it to anything virtual, since it IS the map
* each process has its own page table (so the process knows its CR3 value)


buddy allocator - allocates contiguous pages of memory

==== Translation Lookaside Buffer ====
* TLB caches the results of address translation
* TLB is a non-coherent structure (it may something is valid when it isn't) - because it's not tied to memory
* The TLB is basically a cache of the page directory within the processor (reducing access time by 10 times). Walking the page directory (which resides in main memory) is expensive.



=== Processes ===


The entire kernel must be in memory.

Program vs process (task)
* A process is a program in execution
* The '''loader''' decides what the relocated address will be
* Program is stored in ELF - Executable Loadable Format
* A process and a thread, in Linux, are no different when it comes to CPU time.
* When context switching, you're changing the task_struct

real time processes have their process's first bit set to 1 (so it's quick to look up)



=== Signals ===
Signals are like chords you can pull on a process

Killing a process
* There is no SIGKILL handler in a program because the kernel takes care of that
* Killing a process won't cause its children to be killed. They get reparented.

=== Synchronization ===



spin lock does a busy-wait (unlike mutex/semaphores)

* '''semaphore''' - counting resources
* '''mutex''' is a degenerate case for a semaphore (0 or 1)

You only return failure when the semaphore is available again because it will waste CPU cycles (if you returned failure before sleeping then we're effectively busy waiting)

When there are multiple processors, the other ones must busy-wait rather than sleep wait (via a semaphore)


=== System Calls ===
* '''call''' - takes you to a more privileged level
* '''return''' - takes you to a less privileged level

Linker and loader set the address of function calls (compiler)

before jumping to a specific routine, the sys_call wrapper needs to save all the registers

2. A FATHER'S ADVICE
 
Today, my father told me, “Just go for it and give it a try!  You don’t have to be a professional to build a successful product.  Amateurs started Google and Apple.  Professionals built the Titanic
 
3. The POWER of UNIQUENESS .
 
Today, I asked my mentor – a very successful business man in his 70’s – what his top 3 tips are for success.  He smiled and said, “Read something no one else is reading, think something no one else is thinking, and do something no one else is doing.
 
4. LOOKING BACK
 
Today, I interviewed my grandmother for part of a research paper I’m working on for my Psychology class.  When I asked her to define success in her own words, she said, “Success is when you look back at your life and the memories make you smile.

7. LOOKING BACK
 
Today, as my father, three brothers, and two sisters stood around my mother’s hospital bed, my mother uttered her last coherent words before she died. She simply said, “I feel so loved right now. We should have gotten together like this more often.”
 
8. AFFECTION
 
Today, I kissed my dad on the forehead as he passed away in a small hospital bed.  About 5 seconds after he passed, I realized it was the first time I had given him a kiss since I was a little boy.

he's just the result of a capitalist system.....
I'm not saying I would do the same as him, I still have morals that guide me that don't maximize profit.....
but if you're going to get angry at someone who makes money as a higher priority than morals or charity, you're going to hate a lot of people

Envisioning your goal = not quitting prematurely (like mom would)

===  ===
Once there was a man who did not make it to university. His mother got him married. After the marriage, he worked as a teacher in a primary school. Due to the lack of experience, he was squashed by the students in less than a week.

When he returned home, his wife dried his tears. She comforted him with these words. 'You should not be too sad about it. Probably there is a more suitable job waiting for you out there.'

Later on, he found another job and before long he was fired due to his slowness. This time, the wife commented. 'There are always people who are skilful and non skilful. Some have experience from their years of work. As for you, you were in school all this while. So, how could you acquire these needed skills?'

He went for a number of jobs but never stayed long in those jobs. Each time, he would return home with a dejected spirit. His wife would always comfort him and never once was she disappointed or resentful.

He was in his thirties when he acquired a flair in languages. He became a counselor in a school for the deaf and mute. Later on, he opened a school for the disabled. A few years later, he set up chain stores in different cities and provinces selling apparatus & equipment for the disabled. He became a multi-millionaire.

One day he asked his wife. 'When I was looking bleakly at my own future, what's the reason that you had so much faith in me?'

His wife gave him a very simple reply. She said, 

'When a piece of land is not suitable for planting wheat, we could try planting beans. If the beans are not growing well, we could try planting fruits or gourds. If the vegetation is not economical, we can instead scatter buckwheat seeds. These seeds will one day bloom into flowers. On this land itself, there will be one seed that will germinate and grow.'

After listening to his wife's explanation, he cried. His wife's faith, love, patience, and persistence is likened to the one seed in the land. This is the seed that persists and creates the miracle on this piece of land.

"In this world, there's no person who is useless. It is just that they have not positioned themselves firmly in the right place"

Pandora's box vin dicarlo 3 questions real or a fake scam?

Best Answer:  scam. i don't know how old you are, but you may be the lucky one. it doesn't make any difference if you are bad with girls. today's kids rush into things too fast as it is. take your time. female friends cannot be found in a meat market. you will see a lot of girls that aren't interested in you . that is part of life. but there are other girlS that will be interested in you. after meetimng a girl for the irst time, ask her about her favorite things, hobbies, music preferrences, things like that. once you get past the awkward stage of meeting, let things build slowly . then learn from each person you meet. enjoy

It's okay to manipulate perception even if it's unethical. Because others will have unfair perceptions of you if you don't. It's defensive, not to gain an unfair advantage. It's to prevent an unfair disadvantage.

Domestic cats with homes have a child-parent relationship with their human companions. Result is that they never grow-up and remain kittenish:  friendly and playful. There is more to it than this though. My own cats have often  resented my leaving the house for even a few hours and spent a large part of their waking hours interacting with me. This varies between breeds and individual cats??? also cats that are lavished love and attention by their owners can become extremely responsive and loyal companions.

When a new cat is introduced into a household, squabbles often occur while the interloper tries to establish his or her own territory. Boundaries must be reestablished by the resident cats. Furthermore, when an established resident cat dies, his or her territory is usually inherited by the cat next in the hierarchical line.

Pamela Anderson is doing an ad for Verizon Wireless. They're promoting some new gizmo that lets you watch  "clips from your favorite TV shows" on your cell phone. Pam breathlessly tells the audience that now, thanks to the folks at Verizon, we can watch clips of her in Stacked on our cell phones! WTF?

And then she scolds us for looking at it ("eyes up here!").

Dream that could become a great TV series (drama, crime, thriller)

episode 1 - The outdoor wedding

Tom Noble and Tom Coles' are murdered by a black teenager using a baseball bat or gun in what seems like a violent crime after being enticed through a water bottle in the face at the end of a congregation service.  It turns out that it was to avenge the death of his older brother many years earlier in which these 2 are involved.

in a way i don't remember, and older black man calls the police with a fake name before getting involved in a traffic accident as a result of the call.

episode 2 Arms Park

the man and a female accomplice are drowning in a flood on an elderly couple's doorstep . the elderly man drown in trying to save them while the wife survives. (though there is a teaser that due to some floating vessel the three survive but are not heard from again so far.

The survivor and a couple of others escape through the back door on the run from the police along with the black teenager (again I don't remember the relationship between them). They successfully elude the police in some kind of dock facility. The lady returns to her home. 

episode 3

Many years pass. There is a fat black man who is a truck driver and has established a friendship with the Kudari family due to his regular service to them. He's good at climbing huge furniture which the Kudaris have a lot of. He is in possession of a gun and uses the family to avoid police detectives.

I didn't reach the stage yet, but the Kudari family members lives are endangered.

The fat black man is supposed to be a villain but he is the character in focus that is compelling to viewers because of his values underneath his criminal defence.

this book is not, as I had expected, a book about psychology to help compulsive shoppers gain insight into and control over their urge. Instead it is another book written for retail business marketers on examples of how consumers are bonded to brands. And there are many such boosk.

I was bored of my surroundings in the UK. The same service stations each time. Going on holiday was refreshing but undermined by the exhaustion and the need for improvisation (e.g. not having clean clothes, forgetting to take slippers, having to go through another human being to go somewhere using a taxi - remember I am uncomfortable around people, the  inner city crowd and dinginess). What I wanted was to go to the USA and not be a tourist. Living in the Bay Area turned out to be the perfect  permanent vacation (saying to myself "I'm in the United States" like it hadn't sunk in) and while i didn't reach the point of boredom, 10 years of living in the Bay Area and visiting LA in 2014 planted the seeds for a need to go on a new permanent vacation.

The US, upon moving here permanently, truly was an undiscovered world and "starting a new life"

I'm sad you have to rush such a decision. I'm 30 and every now and then I still regret the university degree I had to decide on in year 11. That dictates your 

A-levels.

Business is much more useful than sciences (and I was always good at sciences).
(I'm simplifying for the sake of explanation, but anyway...)

There are basically 2 types of careers (excluding athletic): academia and professional.

[LIST]
[*]Professional studies (and applied sciences) are more useful if you want to land a "proper" job (doctor, lawyer, engineer, teacher, accounting, architect, 

journalism ...).
[*]Academia (arts, fundamental sciences and humanities) doesn't lead directly to many jobs. Only research or teaching that subject (biology, classical studies, 

history, philosophy, English, political science, physics...). 
[/LIST]

Okay, that's a simplification, people with a degree in English can work for national newspapers etc, but the career path is not so obvious.

So in response to my comment that business is more useful than sciences, that's the reason why. Professional studies lead to proper jobs, academic studies do not.

Some interesting personal notes though: 
1) arts degrees are great for growing as a person. But since money is limited for attending college you have to worry about your career first and foremost
2) I took maths, further maths, chemistry and physics at A-level and am now a computer programmer. But combined those A-levels barely helped me at all. I actually 

found Latin and English the most useful for being a programmer (and I was terrible in English).
3) University admissions committees require certain A-level subjects for their degree, but that doesn't mean you need the content of those subjects actually 

matters. And when it comes to getting a job, having ANY degree is 80% of the challenge overcome (it gives you credibility). The actual degree you take may matter a 

lot less because you learn 'on the job'. I emphasize that's personal experience - you don't want to be a surgeon and not know how a heart works :|

BTW, I seriously recommend you have a look at this page. I wish I knew about this at age 16:

Negative into positive

Leaders often exhibit the wounds from their early losses and have a tenacity, 
even a ruthlessness, that may prove difficult for others to comprehend.
It is said that famous men are usually the product of unhappy childhood. The stern compression of circumstances, the twinges of adversity, the spur of slights and 
Tought conditions, weakness, jibes, cause very strong self motivational background and skills, which are the nature of being successful."

Dependency graphs provide a visual way for you to examine code and understand its dependencies without having to look through files and lines of code. You can see items and relationships as just nodes and links, or arrows. For example, suppose you have a code review to perform. You have a set of files that contain pending changes. You can visualize the code and dependencies for those changes by creating a dependency graph from those files. See Visualize specific dependencies in your solution.

Thanks Sreekanth for nominating me for #ALSIceBucketChallenge . Because California is in severe drought, I dont want to do the ice bucket challenge. Wait for it... I will do something better. I shall do a 3 mile awareness walk for ALS, raise 1000$ for cure and I donate 10% of it myself.

=== pro tools training 110 2014-05-12 protools ===

logic pro more for music creation than final editing (which Pro Tools is for)
Though both can do either

rotary control  (round volume control) vs fader  (lateral volume control)

ATARI for a long time was the best MIDI solution

Apple acquired Emagic (that makes Logic Pro) for the AMS technology, not for Logic - it's not that profitable

MIDI port - same port as the PS/2 predecessor
* useful for connecting to older, but higher quality synthesizer that isn't computer-ready

sloppy disk (!)

midi track (sheet music) vs instrument track (synthesizes music)
computers didn't always have the processing power to generate real sound. You had to feed it out to a hardware keyboard and the output sound feeds it back in. Having a dedicated device is still preferred sometimes 

====   ====
Xpand interface - more lightweight than full virtual instruments but lower quality (like jpg and mp3)

quantize. Useful but for professionals it sounds too computerized and not natural enough

velocity = speed that a key is pressed (so really it's amplitude)

Event = note (more or less)

semitone - c to c#

transpose = change a note to another note

boom drum

midi track vs instrument track

One of the  primary roles of a drummer is to keep everyone else in sync. His role is perceived as "easy" because he doesn't have to deal with notes (to the point of there being well known drummer jokes)

You can't judge energy of a track the way you can amplitude, pitch etc.

live concerts are bands' R & D.

Recording audio from midi is usually done to save CPU load from synthesing. Otherwise there's no need.

In addition to making the characters significant to each other’s story lines, try weaving the plots together so they come to a head at the climax of your story. Maybe the resolution to one plot leads directly to the climax of another plot, or all of the plots meet at one point and suddenly your reader is hit with the significance of everything that has happened in the previous 200-500 pages.

If all you do is reproduce the conditions of that meeting with mechanical accuracy, dressing the actors and choosing the spot for shooting with documentary precision, you still won't achieve the same sensation from the film sequence as you had from the meeting itself. For when you filmed the scene of the meeting you ignored the psychological factor, your own mental state which caused the stranger's look to affect you with that particular emotion. And so for the stranger's look to startle the audience as it did you at the time, you have to prepare for it by building up a mood similar to your own at the moment of the actual meeting.

Episodes are so to speak propped up with a musical accompaniment which reiterates the main theme in order to heighten its emotional resonance

music does more than intensify the impression of the visual image by providing a parallel illustration of the same idea;

Music can be used to produce a necessary distortion of the visual material in the audience's perception, to make it heavier or lighter, more transparent, subtler, or, on the contrary, coarser... By using music, it is possible for the director to prompt the emotions of the audience in a particular direction, by widening the range of their perception of the visual image. The meaning of the object is not changed, but the object itself takes on a new colouring. The audience sees it (or at least, is given the opportunity of seeing it) as part of a new entity, to which the music is integral. 

I have to say that in my heart of hearts I don't believe films need music at all

The plot is what forms a memory in the readers’ mind, allowing them to think about the book and even making them want to read it again

In other words - a story can mislead from reality (selection bias) if it gets the viewer to remember it and come back for more.

Multi strand plotlines

Some stories work fine with a single hero pursuing one goal, but occasionally, a story will get boring in the middle, especially if there isn't enough conflict to sustain it.

The second plotline is intertwined with the first one. Both plotlines affect each other. Otherwise, the story would fragment into two separate stories and it would fall apart.

To keep the story alive, the writer simply jumps between storylines at the height of action, so the audience is constantly engaged.

So, when using multiple plotlines in your stories, make sure that they affect each other in some way,

At the end of the story, bring everything together. End each plotline one at a time or all at once.

After these questions have been answered and you have created a way to drive that theme home for your readers with a shocking or unnerving ending, you can then determine the best and most representative characters to complete those events or make those revelations. This is usually much easier to do than the aforementioned first step, because now, you have a thematic focus to work on and a solid base plot point (the conclusion) to build upon. Finding a character (or characters) to populate that plot is usually only a matter of looking for archetypes that fit your theme.

7 Habits of highly effective programmers



=== ===

Styles have changed, and butt kicking is no longer a surefire laugh, except with children, who still find it hilarious.

=== ===

why building anticipation through foreshadowing leads to satisfaction with a viewer

You are teased getting something desirable and experience part of the pleasure, then are made to wait for it, then finally you are given it.

But it only works if it is desirable to begin with.

e.g. Hogan vs Warrior teased at Royal Rumble 1990. people started getting an idea how epic it would be if the 2 battled to see who is the supreme force

In Atletico documentary, Atletico should momentarily experience something desirable but then have it taken away from them (e.g. promotion)

Give half the ingredients
Malaga shot in injury time to win the league
Correa almost seals promotion
=== ===

building anticipation

* whatever Arnold did before Willis opened the door and the cookware went flying across Willis. Something was done to establish he fact that it was a system. Arnold didn't say when he was alone in the room "this is my security system"
=== ===
video editing
use symbolic events that reinforce the story you're trying to tell. e.g. Man Utd comeback with 10 men to 3-3 in the 80s was a sign of shifting power even though reality was much less convenient.
=== ===
Story cuts through the clutter and strips things down to what matters most. Story says, ???look here??? focus on this.??? As Chip and Dan Heath put it in Made to Stick, storytelling leaders must be ???masters of exclusion,??? relentlessly prioritizing information - See more at: http://castasone.com/five-habits-of-a-storyteller/#sthash.9c00sm2O.dpuf
=== ===

Video production scoring technique

Have different editions of the same song
Eg happy edition, sad edition 
1970s version, 1990s version of Atletico hymn. Also Motivos de un sentimiento

SVCTE video production

open to public
7am or 12:30pm
5 days a week, 4 months

=== ===
storytelling is a simplification of reality
=== ===
Note to biography authors, storytelling
Most people don't want to know the messy, disorganized, incongruent, confusing truth. They want to be told a consistent story that inspires them to augment their own mindset.

buildup and payoff

both in music and in wwf PPV events. Without buildup, PPV matches and raw matches are indistinguishable. At the other extreme "just who will Mr. Perfect be in the corner of?"

=== ===

documentary making

Merge related things into 1 segment even if they are out of chronological order

even if the timelines aren't quite right, put related things together
* e.g. WWE Divas gone Wild - put Sunny = 1996, Chyna = 1997, Sable = 1998
Sable was there until 1996 (before Chyna) but they only begin talking about her a after they've talked about Chyna who debut in 1997.
They shifted anything Sable related to the period when her most famous contributions came.

=== how not to create a documentary ===

Have no change. Everything is in steady state
* e.g. A video with a list of places you encounter the golden ratio, with one section for human body, another for astronomy, etc. This got boring after 2 chapters

=== Movie Script ===
Tinder
Met girl abroad in Bay Area
Few days later met her cousin in Vegas

Most films will also include selective use of other transitions, usually to convey a tone or mood, suggest the passage of time, or separate parts of the stor
===  ===
When to Use the Dissolve

This is the second most common transition used in motion pictures, and, unlike most straight cuts, it attracts attention to itself on purpose. 

The dissolve is most often used where:
-There is a change in time
-There is a change in location
-Time needs to be slowed down or sped up
-There is an emotional component to the subject in the story
-There is a strong visual relationship between the outgoing and the incoming images

Composition – The two shots dissolving together should each have compositions that overlap easily and avoid a visual “mess” – particularly at the midpoint when both images are, typically, at 50% opacity. You may dissolve opposing compositional frames (shot one has its subject frame left while shot two has its subject frame right) to unify the images in one, momentary yet well-balanced dissolving frame.

It is important to note that dissolves can also slow down time and manipulate the emotions of an audience when accompanied by slow motion imagery. A romantic or maybe an emotionally sad sequence can use dissolves rather effectively to slow down events and give the audience time to view and digest the meaning of the material.
===  ===

Wipes are a good way to show changing location.

Crossfades can also convey a sense of passing time or changing location.
Dissolves can better convey a sense of passing time than a cut.

Effective integration of transitions should always be inspired by some aspect of the story that is being conveyed in your video. For example, a transition may signify a change in location, or a change in the pace of the action, or simply the passage of time.  If there’s no specific reason to use a transition, keep it simple and use a cut.

Lighten up buddy. You'll enjoy WWE a lot more if you don't take it so seriously and just love it for what it is. I started watching WWF in 1992 and if it wasn't for the fact I didn't know that it sucked back then too I'd have never got any enjoyment and become a fan in the first place. WWE is a cartoon that both kids and adults can enjoy at different depths, just like Disney.

I stopped watching after WM 15 through to just after WM 21. The "easy to explain reason" is that I moved out of my UK home and it was not possible to get access to Sky TV living at school/college housing. But I had hung on for a few years prior to that despite that handicap. The real reason was that as the attitude era took off and it expanded to 2 hours and became what the "cool" kids at school liked I just got less and less attached to the product. It was too much content to keep up with (I ran through so much VHS tape and shelf space).

Vince McMahon quotes

Vincent K McMahon:

"Despite the way I would feel personally about someone, if it's the right business thing to do, I'll do it for our audience."

"Giving it to the audience is probably the easiest thing. Finding out what they truly want is probably the most difficult."

"If you stop building stars, which we never do, you wouldn't be in business."

"We love our fans, so there's nothing we wouldn't do for them, and we go directly to them."

"Again, the nice part about it is that we listen to our fans, and they're the ones who really decide who is ready to break through into that top echelon."

Whenever I heard the word "charisma" I picture his face and bleach blonde locks.

Does anyone know what his last public appearance was? (I know he didn't die purely from natural health deterioration but it would be insightful to see what he last looked like).

Of the 50 or so wrestlers I've met in the last 6 years, not one had passed away, not even Jake Roberts. This is an unfortunate (but inevitable) first. No matter how many people die, it's something we never get used to and desensitized from. That's the downside of every human being unique and irreplaceable.

I wish he could have made it to his 70th birthday. Somehow 70 is symbolically okay to die after, but 69 still feels just a bit too soon.

I had been dying to ask Dusty "how do you come up with your catchphrases" and I don't remember much about what he said but he did say from things like billboards. I'm glad I got to ask him that a mere 3 months ago, even if I'm no more capable of coming up with them now than I was before asking him ;)

Okay, no such book exists but as a business school graduate I'm fascinated by the principles Vince has used over the decades to guide his business decisions. There are loads more but I never tried to remember them until now. Your contributions are welcome. Until Vince release his own book this might be the most authoritative literature in the public domain ;)

* Forgive and forget...if it's profitable
* Hype your products - even if they're not that good ("Pump and dump")
** Say how great the product was for those that didn't get it (non-buyer's remorse)
* Associate yourselves with mainstream celebrities to add credibility
* Attractive women draw both male and female viewers
* Masses cannot handle complexity. Make your product easy to understand ("lowest common denominator")
* Always use the name of your talent. Never bypass it by saying the pronoun. Each time you mention it, its brand equity increases.
* Be on the cutting edge of technology platforms
* Invest in high end production values
* Don't acknowledge your competition
* Try lots of things, keep what works (as said by Jim Collins)
* Lead by example

* Aggressively counter your competition
* Superserve your market with more product than a customer can completely consume
