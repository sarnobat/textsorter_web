=== keyboard shortcuts recommended ===
These are not for built in shortcuts. They're for ones that you must configure yourself and would forget each time they get wiped, or get inconsistent ones

==== Command Line ====
* Alt-f : find
* Alt-g : pipe xargs grep

==== Development environment (e.g. Eclipse) ====
* ? Ctrl-o : Open resource
* Ctrl-shift-w : Close All
* Ctrl-w : Close
* Close Others

==== Operating System Window Manager ====

focus via wmctrl

==== Source control ====
* alt-s : Status
* alt-c : Check In / Commit
* alt-d : Diff
* shift-alt-l : Log




==== Textmate ====


==== Tips ====
* shortcuts bound to Modified keys (alt-tab) cause more strain than unmodified ones (e.g F1)
* One idea for ordering F1 to F12 shortcuts is by:
** how much of your time the application is focussed 
** how far-reaching the application is network-wise
* The more often a command is required, the less buttons one should have to press

Is there a such thing as a set of standards for keyboard shortcuts? Maybe I should start one ;)
* There are but they aren't standardized for commands that are specialized or core to productivity



=== Meetup - Linux device drivers (13 Aug 2014) ===
Block device - aysnchronous
Character device - synchronous/blocking


drivers/char/mem.c

the struct containing fops_null is the implementation of /dev/null

ram file system - i.e. no backing store. But useful at boot time.

=== Neo4j evaluation (why I like Neo4j) - MASTER COPY, but an alternate version for Objy created ===

I'm talking (mostly) as a newbie developer who is learning to use the DB, not an enterprise architect trying to scale to hundreds of hits at a time.

* neo4j-shell FUSE-like file system (but FUSE would be better so you can use key bindings, command history search, tab completion, dir colors, find command to quickly print paths)
* Embedded mode (preferred initially because of type safety, targetted exception handling)
** https://github.com/sarnobat/neo4j_embedded/blob/master/test.groovy
** Pure java to get all nodes, without ever having to care about any query language (initially)
* Cypher - readable, handles all cases I care about
* Cypher over REST. Not restricted to pure REST GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests
* No need for strong types. It's just an extension of a java.util.Map
* Replication (though master-slave only; not free. Better than nothing - it's reassuring)


What I don't like:
* No remote java database connections like SQL (so non-rest java code must reside on server)
* Pure REST querying - can only do basic queries; output is bloated; no results without autoindexing (I don't want to learn about indexing yet - I still don't know what indexes are)
** REST Output is bloated - but done for discoverability (which in practice isn't that useful)
* Cypher - having to check a property exists before evaluating a predicate on it
* Transactions over REST not possible
* No introspection (I assume; but I've never tried it)
* No asynchronous transactions like Couchbase

=== What is an Operating system ===

Resource management - reduce slack time (that's the main reason for multitasking)



An I/O operation is orders of magnitude slower than instruction execution.  For this reason the processor would sit idle a large proportion of the time, despite the efficiency improvements brought about by batch systems.  Instead of doing useful work, the processor would wait for an I/O operation to complete.  The observation was made that more than one job could be read into memory, allowing the processor to switch back and forth between jobs (or processes, as they came to be known).  While one process was involved in I/O, another could be running - i.e., making use of the processor.  The introduction of multiprogramming or multitasking laid the foundation for many features found in today???s operating systems.

As the price of machines came down and wages went up, the programmers??? and users??? time became an important commodity.  The importance of good response time and short turnaround time were factored into the OS design process.  The major step taken was the advent of time shared systems.  Instead of just submitting jobs, the user was given interactive access to the machine via a command line interface.  Since the processor speed was many orders of magnitude faster than the actions taken by the user, under ideal conditions the user could work as if she had sole access to the machine.

First, detailed instructions had to be written defining the problem and a procedure for solving it. These instructions were programmed by adjusting switches manually and inserting thousands of cables into as many as forty large plug boards. A team of five operators might work several days on the external wiring and many more days searching for errors and correcting them.???


???The switches and controls of ENIAC [which are] now arranged to be operated manually, can be positioned by mechanical relays and electromagnetic telephone switches which are instructed by a Teletype tape. [With this arrangement] tapes could be cut for many given problems and reused when needed???

It soon became apparent that much of the code written for each program was duplicated effort because it dealt with routine input and output procedures, such as reading input from a tape device, or sending output to the printer. Common program procedures were therefore developed to handle input and output via the standard I/O hardware devices. These "device drivers", as they became known, eliminated the need for programmers to write their own I/O routines, which meant that programs could be produced more efficiently.

The operating system, then, controls the operation of the computer. This includes determining which programs may use the processor at any given time, managing system resources such as working memory and secondary storage, and controlling access to input and output devices.

In the early days of computing, scheduling computing tasks was a problem because time on the computer had to be booked in advance, typically in half-hour blocks or multiples thereof. If the operator encountered problems and the program did not successfully run to completion in the allotted time, a new time slot had to be booked and the program would have to be run again from the beginning.

Indians began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living the UK even in the earlier years. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. Later arrivals opened corner shops or ran post offices. The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

20th century

Although post-war immigration was continuous, several distinct phases can be identified:
* workers were recruited to fulfill the labour shortage that resulted from World War II. These included Anglo-Indians who were recruited to work on the railways as they had done in India.
* Workers mainly from the Punjab and Gujarat regions arrived from India in the late 1950s and 1960s. Many worked in the foundries of the English Midlands. Large numbers of Gujaratis worked in the textile manufacturing sector in the northwest industrial towns of Blackburn, Dewsbury, Bolton, Lancaster, Manchester and Preston. Sikhs coming to London either migrated to the East to set up businesses where the wholesale, retail and manufacturing elements of the textile industry were located. Many Sikhs also moved to West London and took up employment at Heathrow airport and the associated industries and in the plants and factories of major brands such as Nestle around it.
* During the same time, medical staff from India were recruited for the newly formed National Health Service. These people were targeted as the British had established medical schools in the Indian subcontinent which conformed to the British standards of medical training.
* During the 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of East African Indians, predominantly Gujaratis but also sizeable numbers of Punjabis who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. Many of these people had been store-keepers and wholesale retailers in Africa and opened shops when they arrived in the UK.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian#20th_century

In the nine-year period between 2001 and 2010, the number of Indian-born people in the UK has increased in size by 43% from 467,634 to around 669,000 (an increase of over 200,000).[12]

20th century South Asian Immigration to Brazil

* The first wave of Indian immigration to Brazil began when a small number of Sindhis had arrived there from Suriname and Central America (mainly from Belize and Panama) in the 1960s to set up shop as traders in the city of Manaus.
* The second wave of immigration consisted of university professors to Rio de Janeiro from Bengaluru, Goa and Delhi who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s.
* Other people of Indian Origin migrated to that country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially Mozambique), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_immigration_to_Brazil
====   ====
According to the 2010 United States Census,[15] the Asian Indian population in the United States grew from almost 1,678,765 in 2000 (0.6% of U.S. population) to 2,843,391 in 2010 (0.9% of U.S. population), a growth rate of 69.37%, one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, although it is still one of the smallest communities in the US, not even completely one percent.[16][17][18][19]

The first major wave of migration, albeit forced, was the mass importation of slaves, predominantly from Africa, in the time period between America's founding and the early 19 century. Slave importation was banned in 1808, ostensibly ending this mass migration. African migrants' early and tragically immoral introduction to the United States has plagued America’s conscience arguably more than any other historical event. Their presence resulted in seminal legislation and legal decisions, most notably in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, all of which have helped define American identity.

The second mass influx of individuals from foreign countries into the United States was the result of famine, revolution, and the emergence of industrialization. These three realities combined resulting in numerous Irish, German, and other European immigrants flooding into the United States just a decade and a half before America's own civil war. Though roughly 40 years before the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, the world's tired and poor sought refuge in the new, promising land of America. This huge influx renewed the European heritage of young America such that until the 1970s, the majority of naturalized citizens in America were born in Europe. The shear volume of immigrants during this period also created much of the impetus behind expanding and honing the quota system still at the heart of much American immigration debate.

The third major wave of American immigration came in the form of laborers from Central and South America. This wave has prompted intense debate across the political spectrum that reaches every policy sphere. The breadth of this spectrum of opinions has exhibited everything from xenophobia to policy opinions that raise substantial security concerns. Regardless of one's opinion on the massive population of Hispanic individuals currently residing in the United States, it is important to understand this population's historical relationship with America. In 1848, the U.S. signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which incorporated 80,000 Mexicans into the United States without their consent overnight. The geographic proximity to Central America, coupled with the massive and porous Southern border, contribute to the overwhelmingly large migration of Hispanic laborers.

==== Third Wave of Irish Immigration ====


Poor Irish in Dublin in 1920s
Centuries-old problems continued to plague Ireland in the early 20th century as a majority of its people lived and died with agriculture.  As agricultural exports sagged, many young Irishmen flocked to the cities for work, but low industrial wages and the condition of urban slums made life unbearable.  In the 1920s, over 20% of the Irish urban population lived in inadequate, overcrowded housing.

Facing little opportunity on the farms and squalid conditions in the cities, the young people of Ireland continued their mass exodus to other lands of opportunity.  For most Irish emigrants, departure for America would be preceded by a gathering of friends and family.  It was called the American wake, because so often those left behind would be saying their final goodbyes.

Nowhere was the influence of the Irish immigrant more pronounced than in America's most powerful city, New York.  75% of the famine Irish landed in New York harbor, and by 1860 a quarter of New York City's population was Irish.
