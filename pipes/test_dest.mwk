=== Anti-british quotes ===

"We don't bother much about dress and manners in England, because as a nation we don't dress well and we've no manners‚"

"The whole strength of England lies in the fact that the enormous majority of the English people are snobs‚" ~~~~ George Bernard Shaw

"In England the only homage which they pay to Virtue - is hypocrisy" ~~~~ Lord Byron

"Boy George is all England needs - another queen who can't dress" ~~~~ Joan Rivers

"The Beginning of Wisdom is the Definition of Terms"

===  ===

unknown in terms of known = the opposite of curse of knowledge

===  ===

Jim Wagstaffe
-------------
Talk about the unknown in terms of the known
e.g. magnitudes - use percentages, not meaningless powers of ten
e.g.2 One number to another (e.g. Each person in Seattle could each have a bed in the World Trade Center')

===  ===


Soemtimes the negative form of a statement is more tangible and powerful than the positive. It's easier to derive an action item from it.

* to live an unfulfilling life, never try anything new.
* you are no more special than any other person in this world

=== Writing ===
There are, first of all, two kinds of authors: 
* those who write for the subject’s sake, and 
* those who write for writing’s sake. 
The first kind have had thoughts or experiences which seem to them worth communicating, while the second kind need money and consequently write for money. They think in order to write, and they may be recognised by their spinning out their thoughts to the greatest possible length, and also by the way they work out their thoughts, which are half-true, perverse, forced, and vacillating; then also by their love of evasion, so that they may seem what they are not; and this is why their writing is lacking in definiteness and clearness. Consequently, it is soon recognised that they write for the sake of filling up the paper,

=== Indians ===
Love superficial attention

=== Indian behavior ===
Always want to put tag-lines with their name. It is not enough for them simply to put their first and last name. They also want to state a quote, or nickname after someone famous (think Orkut - thankfully Facebook doesn't allow this)
