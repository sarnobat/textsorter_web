=== Most natural parent ===
if the majority fall in the category but some do not, but they have a strong relationship with items that do fall in that category, it's okay to put them there. Remember the main goal is economies of scale
e.g. Put the Mona Khan mp3s I have with all the StepZ ones (better would be to modify the category, but this only makes sense after a critical mass)

=== Catch-all bucket ===
Do not use something as a catch-all bucket if it has another existing purpose
e.g. the Linux home directory is used as a catch-all bucket (e.g. flex-sdk/ because I don't know where else to put it), but it is already needed for dotfiles and quick dir switching (e.g. cd; cd mwk). The end result is that you have a huge number of files in your home directory
